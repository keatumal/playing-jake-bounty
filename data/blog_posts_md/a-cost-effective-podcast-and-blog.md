# A Cost-Effective Podcast and Blog

Yesterday, a [soon-to-debut podcaster who has been both publicly and privately supportive](https://mehdiyacoubi.substack.com/p/the-long-game-21-manhattan-project) of my podcast asked me, among other questions, what I use for a hosting platform. I answered the question and after some back and forth ended the conversation by writing, “amazing how much of this can be done for free / cheap”.

Recalling that back and forth this morning, I felt inspired to share the platforms (and their associated monthly costs) that allow me to do what I do at an extremely low cost.

Services:

[Zoom](https://zoom.us), Pro Plan ($8.75 / month) – for recording podcasts

G Suite ($6.00 / month) – for the email address, [jake@blogofjake.com](mailto:jake@blogofjake.com)

[WordPress](https://wordpress.com), Personal Plan ($4.00 / month) – for both websites for sharing blogs and podcasts

[Blog of Jake’s Blog on Tape](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blog-of-jakes-blog-on-tape/id1512035530) Narration (Free) – for audio recordings of blogs

[Anchor](https://anchor.fm/dashboard) (Free) – for hosting and distributing podcasts and audio-blogs on Apple, Spotify, etc.

Garageband (Free) – for editing podcasts

Notes (Free) – for taking notes (blog ideas, podcast prep, edits, notes, etc.)

[Snippet](https://snippet.club) (Free) – for podcast transcripts and clip creation (testing)

Twitter (Free) – for sharing content (automatic when published)

LinkedIn (Free) – for sharing content (automatic when published)

[Superpeer](https://superpeer.com/jake) (Free) – for facilitating paid calls

[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/blogofjake) (Free) – for accepting donations from patrons

Domains:

[podofjake.com](https://podofjake.com) ($1.50 / month)

[blogofjake.com](https://blogofjake.com) ($1.50 / month)

I have not included the costs of my MacBook Air, iPhone SE, WiFi, [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com) (email), or Microsoft Office because, although I use all of these for my blog and podcast, I would be using them regardless. I am currently experimenting with [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) which would also fall into that category. Lastly, I did not include [my podcast setup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085XQJXW7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) since it was a one-time purchase but it is worth noting that it only cost me $99 and works perfectly.

All in all, my recurring costs to maintain [Blog of Jake](https://blogofjake.com) and [Pod of Jake](https://podofjake.com) are $21.75 / month.

Amazing how much of this can be done for free / cheap.
