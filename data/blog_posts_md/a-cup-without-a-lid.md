# A cup without a lid

From time to time, I will post products that I believe are good.

Today I present to you, Unocup.

Tom Chan & Kaanur Papo have redesigned the coffee cup (linked below). I like it and hope it does well. So does the environment. The company states that plastic lids represent 8x more ocean waste than plastic straws. This seems like a good solution to get rid of the lid.
