# A Minimalist's Favorite Products Under $100

Yesterday I sent a [tweet](https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1310962126404620288?s=20) ([from my computer](https://blogofjake.com/2020/09/24/screen-time-the-social-dilemma-and-my-plan-to-fix-my-phone-addiction/)) responding to Lambda School CEO [Austen Allred](https://twitter.com/Austen)'s question, "What is your single favorite product that cost under $100?". I thought about my honest answer but ignored the part of the question which demanded I choose one. My response was well-received in the Twitter world so I figured I would share it here with links for those who are not a part of it. Here are my favorite products that I own which cost under $100:

$90 - [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Now-with-Built-in-Front-Light/dp/B07978J597/ref=sr_1_13?dchild=1&keywords=kindle&qid=1601472712&sr=8-13) (for reading)

$60 - [Nutribullet](https://www.nutribullet.com/shop/blenders/nutribullet/) (for [nutrition](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/21/the-gluten-free-vegan-diet-intermittent-fasting-and-green-smoothies/))

$45 - [Swell 25oz Water Bottle](https://www.swell.com/shop/swell/bottles/?filter=1&pa_size=25oz&really_curr_tax=56-product_cat) (for hydration)

$13 - [Moleskine Classic Notebooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8867320513/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (for morning journal)

$11 - [T&F Wood Clock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075V48V19/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (so I don't need phone next to bed)

In addition to the five items listed above, I would usually have my current pair of running shoes on this list but have not yet found a pair differentiated enough to recommend. I am due for a new pair soon so I am hopeful these will be the ones.

Lastly, my current [podcast setup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085XQJXW7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for [Pod of Jake](https://podofjake.com) obviously is not something that would be useful for everyone but I do love it and it just barely makes the cut at $99 which is a great deal considering everything it includes as well as the overall quality.

One day I may monetize my podcast by offering sponsorships to companies whose products I genuinely love and recommend (I would never do this for others). Until then, I will recommend these few products for free because they have positively impacted my day-to-day and I think they may do the same for some of you.
