# Circles

_Circles_ , the posthumous album of Mac Miller, was released today. It will make some people sad. It will make some people happy. For me it is the latter.

His previous album, _Swimming_ , was a long departure from "Easy Mac with the cheesy raps", the high school kid whose 2010 song, _Nikes on My Feet_ , would have me listening to his music for the next decade. _Swimming_ may have hardly been a rap album, but it was easily my favorite Mac album.

Now, _Circles_ closes the loop. It ventures even further away from a traditional rap album, but I have always enjoyed all of Mac's music, even that of his jazzy alter ego, Larry Lovestein. I have listened to _Circles_ only once through this morning, but I like it. I appreciate its existence, even after his. My favorite songs on my first listen were _Everybody_ , _That's On Me_ , and _Surf_ , in the order that they appear. Still, I will likely listen to _Circles_ mostly in its entirety as an album, just like I did with _Swimming_.

I hope you will give it a listen.

For those who do not know, Mac died at 26 from an accidental drug overdose, a combination of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol. It is a story that is far too common these days. Rest in Peace, Mac.
