# Great Year for a Gap Year

I became a better version of myself by taking a gap year after my freshman year of college. 6 years later, I am in the middle of a second gap year. I am convinced taking a gap year is one of the best things a person can do. Here is basically why:

A gap year is an opportunity to do what you like. When you can do what you like, you learn what you like to do. It is good to know what you like to do. It feels great to do what you like.

You can do anything in a gap year. You can start a business. You can start a blog. You can travel the world. You can live somewhere new. You can run a marathon. You can lose 30 pounds. I know you can do these things and more because I did.

I am happier, healthier, and wealthier than I would have been without a gap year. I am smarter and wiser. I am more positive and grateful. I have a better sense of purpose. I have a better set of habits. I make better decisions. They make me a better person.

Of course, if you are not convinced on the greatness of the gap year, you can always pay full tuition for the opportunity to volunteer in your collegeâ€™s upcoming online experiment.

If you are past college like I am, I have one more thing to tell you. It is never too late.
