# I don’t know much, but at least I know that.

I have spent an increasingly large amount of time these past few weeks informing myself through quality sources (mostly discovered through Twitter) in an effort to gain a better understanding of what is going on with the coronavirus. This has led me to talking to people close to me like I know a lot more than them on the subject.

Having said that, in the scheme of all there is to know about everything, I believe we all know just about the same, which is nothing.

I have long said, “I don’t know much, but at least I know that.” It reminds me how little I know and how much more I have to learn. It also helps remind me to be more open-minded and humble.

Two of the most well-known Greek philosophers came up with this concept long before I did. It was Aristotle who said, “the more you know, the more you know you don’t know”, and it was Socrates (according to Plato) who said, “I know that I know nothing.”

I share these quotes today mostly as a reminder to myself, and if it is helpful to anyone else, like with everything else that I write, that would be a very welcomed bonus. Until Monday, take care.
