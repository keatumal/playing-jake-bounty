# Introducing: Pod of Jake

If you like this blog, or if you like podcasts, and especially if you like both, there is a good chance you will like my new podcast, _**[Pod of Jake](https://podofjake.com)**_. 

I will be posting every episode on [podofjake.com](http://podofjake.com). You can subscribe there and/or wherever you listen to podcasts. The Apple and Spotify links are copied at the end of this post and it is available on several other platforms as well.

Today I released the first episode with Aubrey de Grey. 

Aubrey is the Chief Science Officer and Co-founder of the _SENS Research Foundation_ and author of the book _Ending Aging_. He is working on undoing the damage of aging in order to help humans live much longer and healthier lives than most have ever imagined could be possible.

As you will learn from our discussion, I believe he has a reasonable chance of succeeding.

Enjoy the show!
