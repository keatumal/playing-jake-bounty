# Nobody Cares

Nobody cares about this blog post. Nobody cares about this sentence. Nor this one. Nobody really cares much about most things. Some people don't really care about anything.

I am sorry to tell you, but very few people care about you. Don't take that personally. It's the same for me. If you are lucky, some people do care about you. But none of them think about you as much as you think about you. A few of them may think about you a lot. And a few of them may care about you a lot. One, two, or a few might even be willing to sacrifice their life for you. But again, you are lucky to have a few.

Meanwhile, you are you. All the time. You think about you. Not all the time, but a lot. You can never get away from you. You are naturally biased by your own point of view. You think people think about you because you think about you because you are you, but no one really cares.

Now, let me be clear. "Nobody cares" is not meant to be taken literally. Nor is it meant to be taken negatively. For me, it is a useful hyperbole. It reminds me I'm free.

Here is how the logic goes:

Nobody cares what I write. So I might as well write what I like.

Nobody cares what I do. So I might as well do what I want to.

Nobody cares who I am. So I might as well be me.

A lot of people spend a lot of time and energy acting like they're someone they're not. They won't do what they want to do because they are worried about what others might think. The freeing truth is that they won't think anything at all. Nobody cares.

Well, roughly.
