# Steve Jobs' Life By Design

Yesterday, I finished reading __ George Beahm's book, _Steve Jobs' Life By Design_ , for the second time. The last time I read it was during my gap year in 2013/2014 when I was working on starting a company of my own. It was one of the first books I read cover to cover and it was immeasureably impactful on my perspective at the time. In many ways, it continues to inform how I think about life today. This book is not nearly as well-known as the official biography by Walter Isaacson, which I read as well, but I enjoyed this book more and found it to be more valuable to me personally. The organization and structure of the book is based upon [Steve Job's Stanford Commencement Speech, which I have written about previously.](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/13/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech-2005/)

I often recall quotes from that speech such as "you cannot connect the dots looking forward", "you have to trust in something; your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well worn path", and "remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.‚Äù

Below is a list of quotes from the book that I underlined in my recent reading. Perhaps one of them you will find to be worthy of an underline as well.

Or in Apple's terms, someone who would 'think different.'" - Author (quoting Stewart Brand)
