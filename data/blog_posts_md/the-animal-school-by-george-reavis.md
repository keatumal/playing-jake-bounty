# The Animal School, by George Reavis

Today as many kids and young adults close their books for the final time before winter break, I will share with you a fable about education that an infrequent mentor of mine once shared with me. It was written in the 1940’s but feels as relevant now as ever in what it says about the inadequacy of our most prevalent education systems. I have copied it below for your ease of reference. Have a nice weekend.

_“Once upon a time the animals decided they must do something heroic to meet the problems of a “new world” so they organized a school. They had adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running, climbing, swimming, and flying. To make it easier to administer the curriculum, all the animals took all the subjects._

_The duck was excellent in swimming. In fact, better than his instructor. But he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running. Since he was slow in running, he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running. This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming. But average was acceptable in school so nobody worried about that, except the duck._

_The rabbit started at the top of the class in running but had a nervous breakdown because of so much makeup work in swimming._

_The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of the treetop down. He also developed a “charlie horse” from overexertion and then got a C in climbing and D in running._

_The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely. In the climbing class, he beat all the others to the top of the tree but insisted on using his own way to get there._

_At the end of the year, an abnormal eel that could swim exceeding well and also run, climb, and fly a little had the highest average and was valedictorian.”_
