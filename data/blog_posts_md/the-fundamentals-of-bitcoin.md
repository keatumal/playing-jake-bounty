# The Fundamentals of Bitcoin

You may have heard Bitcoin hit an all-time high this week. Most people think Bitcoin is either a sure thing or a scam. The reality is that it is neither. What it is, among other things, is the best investment opportunity I have come across in my short time as an investor.

For those who know nothing about Bitcoin or those who are otherwise interested in reading my perspective, I wrote a long-form piece called _The Fundamentals of Bitcoin_. I believe my perspective on Bitcoin is more reasonable than many of its strongest supporters and more knowledgeable than most all of its detractors.

My goal with _The Fundamentals of Bitcoin_ is to give people a fundamental and practical introduction to what Bitcoin is and why they might care about it. For those who find this introduction compelling, I will conclude with actionable instructions for how one can quickly and easily invest in Bitcoin today. Inevitably, when I share with people the attractiveness of Bitcoin as an investment, they ask me how much I would recommend they invest. This is a question that everyone must answer for themselves and I will explain why. Still, I will share why I believe investing 1% of oneâ€™s money in Bitcoin may be a sensible place to start. I hope you enjoy this resource regarding what may well prove to be one of the most impactful technologies of our time.
