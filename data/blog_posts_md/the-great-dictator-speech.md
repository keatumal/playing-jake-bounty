# The Great Dictator Speech

I was removing a bunch of old bookmarks from my internet browser yesterday when I stumbled upon an old video I must have saved several years ago. The video is of an incredible speech by the famous comic and silent actor, Charlie Chaplin. It must have been shocking for those who knew him at the time to hear such powerful words come out of his mouth after so many years spent mostly in silence.

As I listened to this hope-filled speech again, I found that it stands as true and timely as ever. That is especially impressive considering that the film from which this speech has been clipped was released 80 years ago in 1940.

If the speech was not already inspiring enough, its pairing with Hans Zimmer's epic score from the movie _Inception_ takes it over the top.

My favorite line is near the beginning when he says, "In this world, there is room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful."

I encourage everyone to watch the 4 minute speech, and I hope everyone has a nice weekend.
