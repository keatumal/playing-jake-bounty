# The Healthy Habits of Jack Dorsey

I recommend [The Jack Dorsey Podcast by Ben Greenfield Fitness](https://podcasts.apple.com/my/podcast/jack-dorsey-podcast-advanced-stress-mitigation-tactics/id283908977?i=1000431922606).

In this episode, Ben Greenfield interviews Jack Dorsey, co-founder & CEO of both Twitter and Square.

Jack is one of my favorite business leaders. I have come to believe he is a good person as well as a wise one.

This podcast focuses not on his businesses, but on his habits and various health practices. I found it to be a fascinating peak into the life of one of the most powerful people on the planet.
