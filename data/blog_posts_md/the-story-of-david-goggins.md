# The Story of David Goggins

I recommend[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=5tSTk1083VY)_[Joe Rogan Experience #1080 - David Goggins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=5tSTk1083VY)_.

In this episode, Joe Rogan interviews David Goggins, a retired Navy SEAL and current world-leading endurance athlete who has run [many of the hardest races in the world many times](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=David&lname=Goggins) and once held the Guinness World Record for pull-ups in a day by completing 4,030 in 17 hours.

Goggins is one of the toughest individuals alive, both physically and mentally. When I first heard him speak two years ago, he made me realize how relatively weak I was, both physically and mentally.

This interview in which he tells his story provides a solid introduction to the man who continues to inspire me to push harder and go further.
