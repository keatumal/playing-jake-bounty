# What Do You Do And Why?

I think there's something to be said for when it's hard to explain "what" you do. The most common paths and careers are the easiest to explain. "I'm a lawyer" is universally understood. The harder it is to explain, the more likely you're doing something unique to yourself.

I also think there's something to be said for when it's hard to explain the "why" behind what you're doing. That means it's hard to justify in logical terms. So it's unlikely to be something memetic or something you're doing for social proof. You must genuinely want to do the thing.

Working on [Base Colors](https://basecolors.com), it's hard to explain both what I do and why I'm doing it. I believe these are positive signs that I'm headed in the right direction, doing the right things for the right reasons. I can't explain why but I'm working as obsessively as ever. Not work really. Play.
