# What do you want to be when you grow up?

The first time anyone asked me “What do you want to be when you grow up?” I said that I wanted to be a professional basketball player. I actually did end up getting the height. I just didn't get much of anything else.

More recently, when people ask me what I ultimately want to do, and by that they mean for a career, I have responded honestly that I don’t really know. It’s not that I don’t know because I haven’t spent a lot of time thinking about it. I have. It’s just that most people when answering that question think about the options that are available now, but I believe in 10 years or 20 years or by the time I have kids as old as I am now the options are going to be radically different, really unpredictably different, exponentially more different than the changes that the generations before mine have observed over the course of their lifetimes. That's not really a prediction. It is an inevitability. Bill Gates said "most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten". I wonder what we might collectively be underestimating about the way things will be ten years from today.
