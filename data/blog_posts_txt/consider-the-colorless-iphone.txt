# Consider the colorless iPhone

There exists a rarely utilized setting on the iPhone which allows users to remove the colors off the screen. You may wonder why this option is available or why anyone would choose to opt for the evidently boring grayscale.

I was introduced to it as a strategy for using my phone less. The colors evidently trigger dopamine which keeps you coming back for more. Intrigued, I went colorless for less than a day before switching back, but several months later I tried it again and it stuck.

Here is how you do it:

Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Color Filters > turn it on and select Grayscale

I have found that while I still catch myself doing nonsense on my iPhone, I tend to do less of it now. Instagram in particular has become a lot less appealing. I deleted the app for now. Still alive.
