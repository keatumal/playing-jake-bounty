# fireresumes.com

Over the last few years, I have spent a lot of time helping a number of people improve their resumes. It is an area of expertise that I have found I have a great deal of confidence in. Recently, it occurred to me that I would enjoy making a little side hustle out of it. Without further ado, I would like to introduce fireresumes.com .

For my non-millennial readers who may not know, fire is often used as an adjective to describe something really really good.

I appreciate anyone and everyone who checks out the website and/or recommends it to someone they know.

We believe everyone has a story worth hiring.
