# First day of work advice

You are here because you earned it. The company interviewed many candidates and chose you to be here while sending most home. Nobody gave you any handouts. Nobody else got you this job. You made this happen. You deserve it.

There is nothing you will do in your first couple weeks to make it either impossible or guaranteed that you will succeed. It is a long game. Try to start good or great but recognize there is no perfect. You will make plenty of mistakes early. Everyone does. All you can do is learn from them and not make the same mistake twice.

The first days and weeks can feel the slowest since everything is new. The work weeks will fly by soon enough, for better or worse. If you don’t have enough to do at times in the beginning, if you get bored, you can be proactive and ask what you can do for people. That is always great. Otherwise, sit tight for a bit. You will be grateful for short periods with nothing to do when you become busier in the future.

As everyone always says, don’t be afraid to fail. The more the merrier if you can take it. Failing means you are trying, especially hard things. That takes guts and ambition. Don’t sacrifice those things for the sake of avoiding failure.

You are going to crush it. If you believe that, you will.
