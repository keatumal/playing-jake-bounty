# How to eat nigiri

Many people do not know how to eat nigiri. For those who do not know, nigiri is the type of sushi with the piece of fish on the clump of rice. People can eat however they want as far as I am concerned, but the right way is to use your hands. You pick it up, dip it fish-side down in the soy sauce, and put it fish-side down in your mouth. Ginger is to be used between bites and wasabi is to be dabbed on the fish, not to be mixed into the soy sauce. I learned this all pretty recently myself, before a three week stint in Japan thankfully. “Kanpai” is cheers in Japanese.
