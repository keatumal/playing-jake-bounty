# How to Escape Golden Handcuffs

Whether you're in big tech, investment banking, or consulting, a great way to escape the golden handcuffs is to hostel hop the world & live cheaply for a while. This is the "quitting cold turkey" equivalent for getting unaccustomed to your high cost of living lifestyle. It works especially well if you are single, don't own a house, and have a lease ending soon or can break it.

Pack a carry-on and a backpack. Cancel all your subscriptions and everything you don't need while you're away. Try to live for under $100 per day.

The goal is not to live that way forever (neither traveling, nor living for under $100 per day). Rather, it is to show yourself that you can enjoy life without most of the things you thought you needed to be happy.

When you get back from your travels, think about what you actually need and what is important to you. Design your life and cost of living intentionally. Don't just go back to your old setup and let costs rise accidentally.

I did this and went from paying monthly rent of $3,600 for a luxury studio to $1,200 splitting an apartment with my brother, both in NYC -- super easy after the above. That was a few years ago, but this really worked for me. If you want to escape golden handcuffs, or simply reset your cost of living, I hope it works for you too.
