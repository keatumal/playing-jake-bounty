# How to Get Rich - Naval Ravikant

I recommend How to Get Rich: Every Episode from Naval.

In this episode, Babak Nivi interviews Naval Ravikant, an exceptional founder and tech investor turned philosopher.

Naval is one of the wisest individuals alive who I have had the pleasure of learning from.

This extraordinarily long podcast (3 hours, 35 minutes) may be listened to in pieces.

It provides some of the best guidance I have come across for building wealth in the modern world.
