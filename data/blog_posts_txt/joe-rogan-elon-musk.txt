# Joe Rogan & Elon Musk

I recommend Joe Rogan Experience #1470 - Elon Musk.

In this episode, Joe Rogan interviews Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, founder and CEO of SpaceX, founder of The Boring Company, co-founder of Neuralink, and co-founder of OpenAI.

The first time Elon went on Joe's show, he infamously smoked a blunt during the interview. The small hit took a big hit on Tesla's stock price. This second time went over with less controversy and includes some interesting insights into one of the smartest and most ambitious individuals in the world.

I admire those who aim to build a better future. There may be no better example than Elon Musk.
