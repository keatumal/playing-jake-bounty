# Merry Christmas!

I have always loved the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like the Christmas music, the movies, lots of lights and greenery, and the spirit. I like wishing strangers a Merry Christmas.

Like it is for most Jews, however, Christmas itself has always been somewhat anticlimactic for me. That is why this year was extra special as I was able to celebrate a real Christmas for the first time with Lauren and her wonderful family.

Merry Christmas!
