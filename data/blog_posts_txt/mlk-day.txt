# MLK Day

I could not remember the last time I had seen Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous "I Have a Dream" speech, so I took the opportunity this morning to watch it.

In lieu of reading a longer post, I hope you take the time to watch it as well. If you only have 5 minutes, I recommend starting at the 12:15 mark. While MLK's dream has become the symbol of his speech, I was most drawn this morning to his preaching of faith that followed, faith in a better future, and in the realization of his dream.
