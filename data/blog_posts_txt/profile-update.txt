# Profile Update

This is what the profile of an individual creator looks like in the year 2020:

In addition to my updated Twitter profile, you will notice that I have added these same links and a few more to the bottom of both blogofjake.com and podofjake.com

There are now multiple ways to follow me on social media (Twitter or LinkedIn), converse with me directly (email or paid call), and support my work (through traditional currency or Bitcoin).

As always, I appreciate your support and encourage you to reach out with any questions, comments, or critical feedback.

Thank you!
