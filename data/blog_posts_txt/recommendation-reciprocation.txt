# Recommendation Reciprocation

A friend of mine wrote this piece recently echoing a philosophy I have written about and firmly agree with. In it, he recalled the story of the first time we spoke. At the end of his piece, he recommended his readers check out my blog and podcast. I would like to reciprocate that recommendation now, not because I feel obliged to, but because I sincerely believe that more people would benefit from paying him some of their attention than those relatively few who currently do. Sam was the first one to share with me the Chinese proverb that I later shared with you. I do not know another college student who is wiser than him. I recommend you read his work at brainofsam.com.
