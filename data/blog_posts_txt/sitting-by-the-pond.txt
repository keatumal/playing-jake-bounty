# Sitting by the pond

Here is something I wrote sitting by the pond last weekend. It is not based on a true story. It is one.
    
    
    I hear the screams of children
    Playing in backyards
    In the distance to my left
    In the distance to my right
    
    I see a groundhog cross the lawn
    He settles by a tree
    
    Two ducks fly out from woods behind me
    I heard their quacks and watched them go
    A familiar hawk attacks in air
    This bird I’ve seen before
    The hawk returns, the ducks fly onward
    It all stays undisturbed
    
    Two finches on branches chase the blue jay away
    Frogs croak from out of sight
    Tadpoles weave through leaves on the water
    Slowly becoming frogs
    
    My brother wheels a barrow down
    It leans to dump some rocks
    A neighbor’s music disturbs the peace
    But only if it steals my thoughts
