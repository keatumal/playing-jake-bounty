# The Healthy Habits of Jack Dorsey

I recommend The Jack Dorsey Podcast by Ben Greenfield Fitness.

In this episode, Ben Greenfield interviews Jack Dorsey, co-founder & CEO of both Twitter and Square.

Jack is one of my favorite business leaders. I have come to believe he is a good person as well as a wise one.

This podcast focuses not on his businesses, but on his habits and various health practices. I found it to be a fascinating peak into the life of one of the most powerful people on the planet.
