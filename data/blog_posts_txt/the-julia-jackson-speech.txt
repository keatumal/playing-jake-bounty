# The Julia Jackson Speech

It is not often that I use this blog simply to share a link to a video. I am doing that today because this 5-minute speech demands it.

Watch and listen to these words from Julia Jackson, the mother of Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old man who was shot from behind seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin this past weekend. Yesterday, I wrote about our divided nation and how it could benefit from more civility, sincerity, and respect. Julia Jackson demonstrates the importance of all of these traits, peace, unity, and faith.

Like any great speech, the video is best, but in addition, the transcript is included below:

> My son has been fighting for his life.
> 
> And we really just need prayers.
> 
> As I was riding through here, through this city, I noticed a lot of damage that doesn't reflect my son or my family. If Jacob knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased. So I'm really asking and encouraging everyone in Wisconsin and abroad to take a moment and examine your hearts.
> 
> Citizens, police officers, firemen, clergy, politicians-- do Jacob justice on this level and examine your hearts. We need healing. As I pray for my son's healing physically, emotionally, and spiritually, I also have been praying, even before this, for the healing of our country.
> 
> God has placed each and every one of us in this country because he wanted us to be here. Clearly you can see by now that I have beautiful, brown skin. But take a look at your hand. And whatever shade it is, it is beautiful as well.
> 
> How dare we hate what we are. We are humans. God did not make one type of tree or flower or fish or horse or grass or rock. How dare you ask him to make one type of human that looks just like you. I'm not talking to just Caucasian people. I am talking to everyone-- white, black, Japanese, Chinese, red, brown. No one is superior to the other. The Only Supreme being is God himself.
> 
> Please, let's begin to pray for healing for our nation. We are the United States. Have we been united? Do you understand what's going to happen when we fall because a house that is against each other cannot stand? To all those police officers, I'm praying for you and your families. To all of the citizens, my black and brown sisters and brothers, I'm praying for you. I believe that you are an intelligent being just like the rest of us, everybody. Let's use our hearts, our love, and our intelligence to work together to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other. America is great when we behave greatly. Thank you.
