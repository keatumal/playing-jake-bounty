# Words have no inherent meaning.

"Words have no inherent meaning."

They only serve to differentiate. We sequence words together in efforts to guide each other's understanding towards the intended message. The message is impossible to communicate perfectly because language is an imperfect means (though extremely useful). They say a picture is worth a thousand words but it would take many more than that to describe one well enough for perfect recreation. If asked to draw a tree, a thousand people will draw a thousand different trees. If the word "tree" meant something exact and inherent, they would all draw it the same.
