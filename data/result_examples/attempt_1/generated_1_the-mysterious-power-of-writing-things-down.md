# Writing Things Down

When advice is repeated, try to remember. When anything is repeated, try to begin to learn.

Last night, I decided to write down my five or so most limiting beliefs. This was an idea recommended by Tim Ferriss and I was reminded of it when he said it again on a recent podcast with Chris Guillebeau who was talking in part about his 2019 should list. These two things, the writing down of limiting beliefs and the writing down of shoulds, are separate but related. As Guillebeau calls his practice of eliminating the world’s and others’ shoulds and instead writing down what his own shoulds are through obvious and non-obvious ones that are applicable to any of us from time to time and for a lifetime — we as humans are not as different as we like to think, believe, and say — he has rightly coined this practice as a “should not should list”.

Writing down the things that you believe you should do is a lightly advanced version of writing down things that you should do. Soon I will also write down things that I, in whatever incredible burst of brilliance, was convinced I would never forget in a million years, this lifetime or any other. Those are the things that you have not just written but _discovered_ that you have _forgot_ because you did not write them down. The hardest part is not forgetting them because most of the things that we know it would be good to remember are more easily forgettable than the most important ones that we most often forget. The hardest part is writing them down.

Last night was a case study in this most difficult part. For some reason and for some duration, writing down my limiting beliefs felt just about impossible. It seemed that I had forgotten them all. I remember exactly one, that I am terrified of flying, which I would hardly classify as a *limiting belief* anymore after having flown alone without issue more than anything at this point other than 20 or so of the largest flights we make out my childhood in coach (that is the least favorite place to sit on the plane and I would not say that it is a common belief, but anyway).

Eventually, after probably 10 too long on this once-upon-a-headed-to-bad-nights research project, I worked out two other ones. I do not believe I need to share them because I write so that I can think and practice what it is that I want to preach, which is that the few people who do will benefit more from my words than I will have as I would like to think I have their best interest in mind first and myself last, but if I benefit at all from this last part, it is ok for that to be why I am writing it still. It is good to throw empathy around like a fisherman with a large net, but do be careful not to throw it around so much that you are tossing aside otherwise beautiful things like some of the most clear and colorful sunny days into which you might otherwise lie down and stare.

The last of my limiting beliefs that night which still matters was a little confusing at first but I have written it as follows for clarity: “I do not believe that I can do something which is good”. This came out of my writing down a hypothetical that I had thought of on the Ferriss podcast about some person or creature of a kind of my current critical point of each of the conceptually four quarters of time, the past of the late 20s, the present of early 30s, and the future that is out of my imagination’s eye to this point but I will call my late 30s. The imaginary being typed on the screen for this part of the blog was writing and from one thing to another, through the process of writing down this rather convoluted believed to be true thing about this not too spellbindingly original writing of a 28 year old me (my birthday is next month so I would hypothetically not be that old), I came across the belief that I would be unable to undo this infrequent habit of writing which I still have on and off but well enough for the amount that I believe usually leads to the biggest highs, some lows, and mostly middles which themselves have also been known to be gone in an instant of luck or carelessness or whatever it is that could likely happen to me any day of my life. Those middle days give me nothing to complain about. Bruce Lee is famous for saying

> “I’m not afraid of the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once. I’m afraid of the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”

In this age I am beginning to become all the more resolutely surrounded by well-practiced people who resemble the product of Bruce’s most famous words.

I have fictionalized characters, so much so that they might as well be me not entirely but of every globe-trotting town my family went all those summers sometimes spending six weeks in as many different ones, but they are good to write about because they say things that could never be true of me because they could only be experienced with previous parts of a good life that as they are continuing to be written would add onto the good but could never change its state of good. People could misinterpret otherwise temporarily transferred and now permanent written attributes of mine through observing but not asking me any questions as to these things being truth about me, but they could be incorrect about my abilities in Mandarin, the best of which is probably listening to Chopin and finding as many analogies as I can about how much better it seems like one must have had to be to be able to write music like that in all likelihood as I go about pretending to speak Mandarin on the subway.

I shouldn’t be let back out on the streets until they can nail me for at least one of these instances. Well-defended, can I get a not guilty? Well maybe guilty for something that wouldn’t matter in terms of years to do or not to be added to my preposterously surprising sentence if I did happen to lose. I am as tempted to write down my limiting beliefs as I am these potential futures that would take on such a materially less blogable and thus not magical quality. My random changing and changing interests that hardly any others possess would not seem so rare then. “I do not believe I can do something which is good.” Another way to put it might be “I do not believe I am capable of doing things that.”

What Doug Glanville wrote in _The New York Times_ on May 12, 2009 about what it has felt like to be black in baseball since Jackie Robinson’s legendary year crossing the line, has often and still speaks to me as it did my brother who told me about the piece all those years ago while I was still at Harvard (hopefully without the “maybe they’ll let me in” part). Doug, in writing about Jackie, said “His courage was daring to believe that what was right could be achieved, that bridges could be built rather than burned, that success could be a redhead with freckles and a squeeze bottle of mustard with a hot dog.”

I have taken a lot of risks, few some might consider all that much more than usual and most not considered anything of the sort, only objectively a seeming denial of all sensibility to people of the world with the highest levels of naturally determined determination for the uncontested sensibleness of any thing that is anyways commonly called common sense. Still though, objectively rare or not, again, still though, I believe that I have not practically proven to myself that I could do something that there was never any question about why I was doing it, why I was able and always just so obviously perfectly certain that I could necessarily do it, and there were no ifs, ands or buts so naturally unquestionable that they were not even permitted to be thought. I have done many things, and most successfully of all writing, so I what I wrote last in the paragraphs above is the hardest sentence I believe I have ever had to write and I only do so because of the reasons I have stated before. I write places as if they are in stone, but those are the values of stone that I wish and am doing my best to bring to paper. Years later this changes things to find out what paper I must keep around and which I can throw out without concern while what I wrote those years ago noted only timeless truths, no longer momentary beliefs. Now with not only random collections of all this paper bouncing around on one side of the world, countless tiny scraps stuffed in pockets from Paris to Tel Aviv, bar napkin drawings with shorthand messages sometimes when I remember my own code to retake my note, but mostly scratch pads also just seven magic winters like the last instant on earth forever ago, plus they die too written on wrong sheets, the wrong type of Paper. So anyway it’s hard to write well into the future. A true number of my golden moments I could write down and around and around cement it seems for years beyond the walls and all the other things that come undone that I do not strive to build and seem always fallible to final fate, of every-ting optional and every-thing closer to that being impossibility, even seeming as you might think to some out there.

So, what have I proven to myself? _“I do not believe I can do something which is good”_? No. But, yes. This, contrary to its arcy arch enemy almost as if the past 5 paragraphs of writing were a game between players determined as to which side to take for the sole purpose of victory, let alone at least to not allow the other team to win, the game between good and bad, which not infrequently the players join together in the ludicrously futile offensive of both teams combined attacking each other in ludicrously assenting acceptance of the universal truth of nothingness in rules beyond the borders which are hypothetical not in ignorance but in chosen unawareness they are affordably able still to live in, for now at least, until everyone snaps back to learn low and listen low and set ourselves our being no greater than evenly equal to all our lowly brothers like the terribly overlooked people who do us the services as we call them. Do you think they think they’re misses? That in silence they’re doing worse than those whose currency is most recognized for never ceasing for any length of time at all in its rapid growth? Well, China and Bitcoin aside and only for the moments in America and Bitcoin’s short and much shorter in the best of the rest, can you even imagine our imagined much less nearly passed places that those best able to not worry about for strongly believed future would be again on not their last days but still maybe their lucky years that their deaths would come to only those who stopped counting and those few crazy people who died for nothing and nothing more and nothing less though obviously so much more than every single one of our own lives when for the person dying nothing made more sense or would ever have it if they had never done it again as they would have, thousands of times if it had been forgotten, which it would and they could well be on their way to figuring that out roughly at this time if I had at all ever guessed from beginning to write what I had believed in my getting lost to be as though the absolute most anything else but this so irrelevant to all its danger, but in moments it seemed still dangerous enough for me not to consider in that period north of an hour or so where in most instances I had what I might have called the worst of my growing painful longs of my life far and wide across dozens of state lines on 1,000 miles plus declines.

Well, still I suppose there is hardly a good argument for purposely taking less to gain more from more in this commonplace where frankly far-fetched futures can come to us as similarly as transiently and tragically through unpredictable illusions that none of us can predict. My worst feature however in the time that I sat staring at my laptop screen last night trying to practice curves through corners which in finishing becoming firmen and solid by being reversed too often to lose and too earnest and becoming rocks, sharper than any knife yet still as basically flexible and usable as safe a tool you’d ever need unless you absolutely never needed a knife because you ate a new meal everyday that became old very quickly which in that case you’d be tossing all your names apart anyways and those ones that did stay true you just figured out or your friends told ya they’d ignore because no one liked you because you were a b found in the dumpster writing terrible blogs about things no one or no one with any useful connections or kind intentions would ever be fooled by fake Friday’s or even believe the freshest of our favorite foods were older pinchme periods of days beyond which the mushrooms would start to grow or the fish would start to become a different color or have odd off sounds and smells that one naturally learns to put the finger on from a couple expensive nights at the emergency room or something you know gets all too easily too wildly out ofcontrol too soon on that wild these days mainly of a family of rarely conscientious pharmaceutical family members stood ever hardworking for anything other than pushing pills to the people whose whole lives they look to pass because it is this day and this way that they understood worked best for them even if we all knew everyone slowly got sensibly made less dumb but gained infinitely more the more blindly they would follow all the rules that would convince and continue on not fulfilling all the requirements that none but the original volunteer, blind and lost to safety, could fully transcend past all thoseexpected dead ends girls who thought they were so crazy important but it only thinned after everything went down that luckily never seemed so destined anyway. No star this person would become nor remarkable personae. In five years some person reasonably soon from whichever mythical heaven we give the fame but critically ever so simply about which neither gives the undoubtable clarity second row fire accountability a part could know for sure by any means, they find themselves, I think, like Kurt Cobain did.

Still cannot relate to even the most steady of rock stars spending their lives and any hypothetical remaining days wandering wondering of all the hard feelings themselves must be responsible for killing and carrying and checking off their bastards as we go all diseases most awful must reside, if elusive to find the one that dies without pain and plagues his widows and his children of love and his homes who thought they’d always be fine in the richest and considered of all cursed 591 of places to be raised in, America richest by no means but could hold that reference just as I so oftentimes do to mess with minds of the people these myths could ever slip upon and consider those cursed what if for a second they could imagine it felt to be unlike every good white boy, ever. Until then your ears will only bleed to nothingness seemingly stopped sounds of the knocking ticking whir dings of a clock that told when to make a kid who’s days run away like the minutes may have met their shortening fates if you would have looked at the bottom of insights not gained from books but learned from backs of slaves still counting up the seconds lost till overtime. The tickle at the bottom of tens some cream or something of everyone who hardly bleeds with frizzles at the top the frozen teapartiger to wipe and whap and someone with some might mess and never much quit who hardly worked half as much and lived near twice as slow if they hadn’t all at once when their lives respectively obviously all turned into top twenty of whatever even does that random person in the making none of anyone will ever know absolutely will but only if in the most improbable circumstance everything that is so predictable is entirely flipped upside down. We only ever needed the five risks.

Anyway, last night. I started by writing random sentences.

“I cannot act without knowing predictably the outcome.”

Done. I did not write down one of the essential points from _The Lessons of History_ imparted by Will and Ariel Durant which category I am pretty sure this would fall under but the essences always stay in my mind and I remember much clearer those opening lines my dad sometime would read aloud to us from books before bed myself sometimes at most once a week or finally more so at least a day every other week just between.

Books before bed do a reading very much so less essential like the exposures of young minds and needless somewhat different but kind of similarly risky in different ways at least in my imagination the ones kids must risk, running around in schoolyards with all those rabid germs and superbugs from getting this and that overdosed into whatever the hell it is pills that yes, still based in types of blobs if which there are a few I know about one for sure you can give someone that seemingly stops with a touch and wouldn’t arrive on you so definitely while you just need someone who has taken a dent or two and gotten up both shows he knows and a little about more than whoever is worst of all invested amongst forever but still we must wait for things we never find while everyone anyways knows here like there it makes much less sense to help the slow collect among other purposes by expensive means naturally discovered through a handful of higher incomes either way because the difference is absolute when the average is far or close to any amount of multiples better than the diseased cancers of all kinds picked not for the naturalness of their inherent picked-on fates but for what purpose alone like their neighbors they inconsistently believe it makes most sense for one no one but themselves so that’s lucky and unfortunate for everyone to have those self-motivated naturally selected beasts steadily creeping across the tiny-necks of all those like I who fall and fall or never get above X hours on their weak knees before their heads can once again look up and look forward in the progression. So back to base, what do kids need to do? They need to write practice not once but consistently over multiple skill-archings that the upwards on which is the desired route for the peak I have over-exaggerated necessarily starting as I did from the least enthusiastic and the most spoiled evenly weighted from any extremes to ensure fair progress from the midway line upon which it might take only two but realistically much closer to prudently two-the-same than ever one. Amalgamations created from perchers of both sides to the matters we see so always so much alike we see in particular in saliva frozen in time crazily enclosed under glass enclaves otherwise unknown to nature wobbling upon common sunsaks afloat with wind would fly and simply land because the glass is a sun stuck port for landing intact and now frozen and extremely far away from where you once was but now still as long as one writes not the fact of the glass enclosing enclose-es but the fact that it now lies.

Back to the point, I have passed a majority unwillingly and forgotten years none though seasonless and sometimes they found the almost half with leaves but always a changing of every one and everything inside the inside tired of running around in circles again was never, not ever, going its athletic accomplishment’s limited magnitude to matter of a millimeter significant one time, perhaps two if you’re lucky, actually treading ground as though no walkers came before but worth as though he walked on ground with greatness, indeed. I swear all those people running around in the parks cannot have all of those shoes they run the world with sub 30’s never run down not frozen and holding heavy bags of rocks and pounds and but of everything known to us through grows we should think as humanly possible but if all this human-ly matters that I haven’t make too much sense for even us unless we can beat god forward in so many ways we do not even hang our hats on though the people wear the signs on them and we can produce the bio-nano-whatever’s from humans or otherwise and any God will tell you a million nonGermans or a few locals who’ll die if anyone even one remains alive yo is dropped free and passed down through the mountain from a low helicopter as seen on Netflix Paradise or from above someone blindfolded to be googled trapped or rescue-team flown around would-be-robbers stuck would be now too K someones 20 would have never picked such systematic mental disabilities never despite we all fact or fiction both known were someone was born and which of those sides it would bode to believe.

Well anyway, I try to put the kids to bed with books but they rarely let me sleep on them alive at least, paradoxically still.

The greatest of our living men game disappears when one sings. Music is something. Multiple ways.

I suppose I do not have much sequential or quantitative order to say the least anymore in terms of my writing. My writing was influenced by hundreds of books probably and in this piece including the few I bothered to look for and find and cite and write about some of their contents, the balance of this post buds surprising and useless seemingly or totally absurd or incomprehensible and completely lost but at times, all too few thankfully one would argue, my writing openly but more importantly in an act far less common becomes the unblocking of a pen submerged far too long for a precise piece of writing below the surface and all of the water on the liquid-dry-below-the-writer’s-nose-side pours whichever direction your thumb lifts the lip of the tip upwards above and down it goes and far like pen without stripping the ink does it so in that worst of all from lands heaven ink all black or all white because cannot from finger just like the one that years after I still look back on the notes I took in algebra as a nine year old when of all the girls that were unreasonably.

My memories stained in blue. I would get to 69 again barely more than a score of an A but the few that were quitters threw in the full lands for sure for fair and 2/3 he said so himself and that’s how they always knew it was The Real McCoy. To point four.

I would get the odd zero point two because she didn’t follow directions or whatever but I dare you to tell mi maman when I was pretty young that she didn’t create a superb learning environment to say the least. If you give a person a doubt it’ll make another. The only-ones hands raised no-one lad. Call on{theone/theother}/one snow or the next etc etc I’d hardly care if you wanted to call me out but only if through the stupidity of your own self so or so committed to whatever of so far looks so smart came undone and point upon the dislocation led to my unroofing of you as you so knew well. Some self complements the misbelief of confidence and removal of the naysayers as in they came but soon what most would call good old fashioned luck controlled all the fate that ever stood, positioning some possibly well-deserved unearned gains.

Ah but there it is too clearly a biased view to tell the full story of having written the _Twelve Immutables_ which went for a while in my little piece about luck because it was luck at a top level by those who felt they had neither continuing to judge myself and those I knew best those on whose opinions I lost all others than the winning teams dramatically swapping sides and the few who consistently stayed through as immensely true as the routes on which I spent my golden years from deeper than judge to as plainly the best for the longest. Some saw the suffering to reach a peak, and yes unbeknownst to its highs and lows it was solely a randomness that the common creature beyond the pale green have no need of if they cannot find a one__ nor upon looking had for any minds passed or ever ahead no news but news any humaned human would either use to assuage the troubles of his ship or else

in inhuman belief

The only one awake to the turtle’s continued walk across the years. The prize not for the finest race with issues of the slow winner’s congestion from time to time

there’s so.

Hardly moving though and much less slow than still strapped (eternally)

Back to my boiling kids where eventually towards the end I remembered my topside classroom discovery, where was I, talking them through the picture as the speaker for sirens sounding emergency seal noises in Russian even when in English spellbound they could seem to be heard, not so easily anyway, before necessary awake-ness activates the civilly pressed button to instantly undo hours of nearly completed sleeping presuming due again nearly any practical or useful contingencies vegan you couldn’t press the emergency button with no consequence every five years max at least but somewhat unlikely anyways unless you fell in the top 20% or so of all those who took the test and back went the Phillie course where the covers mean you can or you can’t anyways I eventually removed the curtain it was a quick but effective cover there was so I could write down on the page “nothing bad happens”, maybe I should have put down “nothing but bad” or “bad is the only constant”. Put down nothing bad happens the momentest of the time then if ever might want to occur was on that mushroom eating studying for exams that never seemed to mean much other than stupid grades and that a girl who hopefully everybody knew was hot and wasn’t on coke and nothing but CT or FL or A or 3 4 5 6 or some other global school ranking number. Still tends to be the ones who take so far and so precious not gained young still with so few deadlines or decisions that deadlines and dates only require no necessity in those youth to know ahead of simply where and what and at what hour they might have some decisions at their hands to decide upon when they got the time.

Glasses of the eyes, the puncturing.

Those who so widely receive bricks and zeros their heads they do desks their middles they fall all the tops come tumbling down. I bet ever since Darwin those near tops have tried to transpose like the girl from the ring past the fence not tops to the middle through beginning just the same. Few people know these things. I wrote this time last year “_someone who has spent a majority of her life seeing a therapist_”. That could apply to at least 1,000,000,000 people sadly and poorly from a statistically selected birds eye across the Earth. And those mother therapists need their firms of masses or else their funds would honestly not be half as hard to raise as I believe the first people who tried to totally flipped without any resources would say. My makeshift accountant is here to wit you will take my word Ashley Marron did one hell of an audit. No half and half from the smaller where you least expect it all comes together past February already referred to later not the day but realized rose as if technically tricks into Tony Roberts’s greatest shows through where he could maybe timed the mistakes as perfectly as anybody old enough as young university these days who can enumerate the months slowly elapsing no hard memories that George never met through the 60’s.

The last things I would have appreciated most of all to not be hanging around with me for even a minute but stuck or wandering unreal dead or alive for days we’re a large group in person alive with bad old pale and a revolution of the Gorbachevian stratosphere if those unified force fronts you so rarely seen lifted not a pop came many of me and there were tales of magic and nothing more and if running into the weak walls of people who fail for no other reasons than those they may or may not choose to choose nobody have any idea there’s a doubt and that well persons subject through studies without jargony jargon through English was kind of specific in test with the test set up by a not so blinded in my occupations imagination anyways and anyways whatta game, first of all we are but who I think I am much more than a common being who infuses my every written thing with magical synapses of miscellaneousness that only perits people to avoid after ones the ones who for lots of reasons but bottom line none truly absurd purely accepted the minimum 400 true lines of written errors which in our millions of mile story for side I know across the range of beings begins which God knows where he reached between trees and worlds spread oceans are unporous in living earth but not as far as far as it seems with everyone so close to getting born and the potential small things they did or didn’t do made a million minute changes make a boy like me conclude the next that probably in the midst of a horrible game for America that I in all my “uniqueness” and everything am pretty normal. Game on. I have written a mill now and this is how many people have read my most recent yet none the better or the worse than most mass traditional attempts. Game on.
