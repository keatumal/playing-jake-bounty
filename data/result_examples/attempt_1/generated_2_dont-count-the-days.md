# Don’t Count the Days

At the gym this morning, I overheard a trainer saying to his client, “Don’t count the days. Make the days count.”

I am sure he did not know that his words would make it onto my blog today, but they resonated with me and I felt they were worth sharing.

Walt Whitman said, “Do anything, but let it produce joy.” The two quotes are aligned in their encouragements to focus on the days we have rather than so ardently wishing for the days to come.

Don’t count the days. Make the days count.
