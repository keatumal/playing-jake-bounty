# Complexity & the Limits of Knowledge

"When you hear someone being extraordinarily confident about something that you, yourself know nothing about, you don’t have to just assume that they are right."

I wrote that in a post [called Duhshvitz](https://blogofjake.com/2023/09/02/duhshvitz/) last month. If you have not read the post, I recommend doing so before proceeding with this one.

My initial inspiration for Duhshvitz was a recent news article about the conflict in Ukraine. I once learned from [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) that the world’s most unread publication is the "World Atlas." It makes sense. No one reads what they are already considered to know, unintentionally proving the fallacy that one can fully know the world by knowing the world on average.

Mutatis mutandis, I wonder whether people only read the publication that they already consider themselves knowledgable enough to read in order to avoid appearing to themselves or others to be ignorant of something that they consider themselves knowledgeable enough to know. In short, by only reading smart people's articles, people seem to be smart people instead of sounding stupid people.

Or maybe they just enjoy reading about certain topics. That would be fair. But the argument stands that no one knows everything and, generally speaking, people do not speak with the humility that accompanies that simple and often difficult to believe truth.

For some things, people know that they do not know them and therefore do not speak about them. For others, their ignorance is either too great or [too difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Stupid) to fathom, and fortune favors the courageous. That’s how we get books on topics like physics written by sports commentators.

But this blog is not about physicists, it’s about people, and philosophers were people, literally. They were/are logical and scientific and smart like the best of people, and human like the worst, just like the rest of people. That's why I was pleasantly surprised during my reading today to find among the pages of _The Complete Works of Aristotle_ an ancient and oft-quoted expression of one of The Greatest Philosopher's greatest teachings from one of the greatest philosophers who never wrote a word. It was based on the character Socrates from one of the many works penned by Plato. At the top of the page in my book:

"_A Socratic Perspective on the Human Condition_"

The quote was as follows:

"He [Socrates] knows that he knows nothing, and that is why he is the wisest man on earth".

And with that, I leave you with apologies for my [\_ex_\_](https://substackhq.com/invite/161876/gb5nn0iq) and echoes of the post I have previously referred to again and again.

Sometimes people do not go far enough out of their way to be aware of their own ignorance. By putting themselves on such an impractical pedestal of knowledge, they do not help others sit together as wise and understand that we cannot be wise and humble while making plays to appear otherwise.

Authoring a little bit of knowledge for the unaware is much better than making a lot appear for the unaware that surprises even the author with his own to further deceive others and himself into forgetting the difference between right and wrong within the bounds of humble and the impossible ever-solid confidence of otherwise.
