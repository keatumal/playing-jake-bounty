# Controllables

The formula for success, however one wants to define it, is simple enough to explain in a single phrase:

“do the right things and try your hardest every day”,

but impossible to execute with anything close to a perfect record.

That’s why it’s helpful to understand this simple distinction that comes from the world of athletics. You can control your inputs but not your outputs. You can control your effort and your intention, but not your results. In other words, you should focus on the controllables.

My parents told me to play the game, not the result. My baseball, and later basketball, coaches told me the same.

In business, my bosses and professors preached the process not the outcome, and to control the controllables.

It’s hard to argue with the wisdom of intuitively understanding the game and focusing on the obvious things you can control. Things like fundamentals, decision making, working hard, trying your hardest, concentrating, composure under pressure, energy, attitude and effort.

One could not imagine a basketball player intensely focusing on making a specific shot once, or a football team obsessing over winning a game while neglecting to practice sprucing up their blocking and tackling. And yet somehow, these kinds of backwards focus seem common in business, where people talk about “winning” and focus on their “win rate” and “goal attainment”. I think these terms distract us from doing things the right way and trying our hardest every day. As fluffy as that may sound, doing things the right way and trying our hardest are the best controllables I could think of, and doing things that approximates that is the outcome that one must focus on in order to control the controllables, much less the outcome.

The most successful people in the world, however one wishes to define them, don’t fundamentally do things any differently than the least successful people. The simplest fact to suggest that they do is that they can be found doing things others are not doing. They work hard. They try hard. They stick with it longer. They keep coming back to the drawing board. They put more things through the controllable funnel than the average person so that maybe just one or a few things squeeze through to success. They success and more importantly for the most part they don’t do things differently than you or me, they just do things more. But still the things they do are not hard to understand so there’s no excuse to get them wrong. It’s easy to know what we need to do. It’s hard to do it.

So while I may not personally believe there are keys to success many people haven’t ever experimented with, that doesn’t mean I think these keys should be dismissed. To the contrary, the things we already know we need to work on are the hardest things for us to actually do and therefore the most essential to keep front of mind both in thought and practice.

The most dangerous thing about success is the way it is frequently attributed in hindsight to luck.

Luck is frequently blamed in hindsight and rarely though of or respected appropriately in real-time. Those who mistake luck to be useless do so at their own peril. Luck cannot be controlled, but it can and should relentlessly be shot for.

Optimally acting luckly is not done by lucking oneself out and hoping but by looking oneself in and working those controllables with love. It often times does not seem one is becoming more and more lucky doing so, but it will most certainly feel as though one is, and many successful siks later, it may just be inevitable that one does so undeniably become evermore lucky.

Do the right things and try your hardest ever day. Focus on the controllables. Act as though you are lucky and take the chips when they fall.

I wrote this post early this morning after a less than perfect round of golf yesterday. It became much clearer for me while being coached through those controllables in practice after the round and it helped me focus my thoughts while I played. It helped me keep my hat on straight. The positive points of practice are sometimes easiest to see and most accordingly respected on the field. It’s a primary part or so it seems of the purpose of practice, to get the positive points across to be practiced if one can acknowledge them while at play. Practice may also be a place to get worked on in other ways as well, but more with an eye on identifying areas one may have the ability to prove or need to keep improving. Keep on the lookout for those too, and you will have more processes focused on than those you are forcing yourself to try to attack which you are no longer inclined to follow. Don’t force yourself to go for the processes which you may no longer naturally keep. Change them, or test you will have the perseverance to continue doing what you formerly did well out of pure game-time instinct, now required with intentional decision and focus in order to be performed successfully time and again in practice. As one indulges in such play with enduring process, and even practices the game to remove oneself from a state of habitual deliberate practice, self-discovery becomes self-exploration which becomes the joy of the journey one lives, chooses, faces alternately hesitantly yet headstrong to the naked untrained eye, if you can see it, and as clear, fresh, and beautiful as day to the keen-witting sane spirit, when surrendered to about the right length of time, and even longer, if needed, with the use of both eyes, a healthy focus, the strength of a handful, and an open and grieving heart, the silent yet steady and intimidatingly unstoppable foundation of a single victor, one who, with only the intention of seeing, will avail themselves, overcome, acquiesced, bent into the frame, indicted not, but freed from even the least sequence of which they came, or thought they did.
