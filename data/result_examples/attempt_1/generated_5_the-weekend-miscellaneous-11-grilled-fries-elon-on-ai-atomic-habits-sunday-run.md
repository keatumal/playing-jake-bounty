# Weekend Reflections (October 14-15, 2023)

It is hard for me to recall a time when I cooked so many meals over the weekend. It was probably when I was living on my on in Westwood while attending graduate school at UCLA. Over the past two days, I cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner on my own four times as well as eggs for Eileen's breakfast this morning. Mostly the meals were simple, but I made a few things that were more involved including burritos from scratch keep reading if you want to learn the easy way to make the best burrito you have ever tasted.

Another reason why I cannot recall a time when I cooked so many meals on a weekend is because I more commonly spend Saturdays and Sundays going out to eat for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner. I still went out a couple times over this weekend, but even in those cases we had food from an Indian place in Chicago and ran down the street to a diner in my Michigan hometown yesterday for their "Saturday All You Can Eat Cod Special". So as you can see, this was more of an at home weekend than I typically would prefer, and though I sometimes sound like a broken record, I would encourage anyone who enjoys my writing to also pay attention to my recommendations. I have started running regularly again in part just to give me an excuse to listen to a podcast and I have gotten back into posting my food as well. With practice, these pastimes may again come to feel less like I "have to" do them if I want to become better than I already am, but right now they feel and are most definitely enjoyed as things that I "get to" do. It was good to be reminded of how much one can enjoy seemingly any and everything with the right amount of mindfulness. There is a whole wide world out there after all, and there's rarely reason not to look around once in a while. Below are some the podcasts I listened to, the book I read, and more details about some of the things I came by on my run, all of which I wouldn't"be" the man I hope you'll agree I am, not[able](https://specialcharacters.substack.com/p/unable). Still, there is no substitute for you to be you so I encourage you to do what you want and to want what you do.
