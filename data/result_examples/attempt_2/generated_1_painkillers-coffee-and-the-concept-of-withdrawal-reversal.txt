# Withdrawal Reversal

Every time I go for my morning walk before the sunset I get the same sounds. The sounds are unrelated, probably viewed as nuisances—barking dogs followed by birds—as a very small mammal avulses itself from the very large mammal it calls its owner. As I continue walking and they continue barking, the small mammal relocates from the large mammal’s side to my left side. At least it has found where exactly it wants me to walk, I think. It does this repeatedly until we reach the final point of our Cartesian coordinates. Its constantly evolving gait reminds me of my own posture walking on stilts. When we reach the tree for which the 8am walk with Nina is a common destination, I know right away when to slow my speed. The bark is barely visible, but I can hear it becoming louder and louder each time the doorway to the world closes. It is becoming louder and louder and louder and suddenly, in a medium-frequencies burst, there is no bark at all. 

To me, the beauty of coffee and addiction is that they work almost exactly the same way. Coffee mellows, addiction hones, and suddenly the oozing laughter we heard before is so loud it might be difficult to hear the newest news from fourth floor. 

And so that brings me to my simple questions with no simple answer: are there reasons not to take a break? Do prescriptions of withdrawal doses and frequency distance withdraw the reverse path?
