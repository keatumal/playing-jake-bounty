I’m at around 80 pages into noahharari.com’s Home Fire.

I’m listening to a podcast (Panoply) with a hip hop artist called Lin-Manuel Miranda, who produced and starred in a musical called Hamilton. I wouldn’t mind getting the soundtrack.

I listen to No. 3 Son Travel’s Travel a lot. The best podcast I’ve found so far is Podcast of the Century with Chang and Yang, called “Cryptocurrencies and Implications for Online Banking.” At dinner tonight I was telling someone about this.

I read a book Last month with my friend Shane called Cyptocurrency and its Implications for the Financial Mind of the Future. Shane sent it over to me after we discusses the concept. I’m now reading mama dashI and pappa harJ. Pappa hates port.

I randomly met someone in the LAX airport here in America along the lines of “wow we should exchange contact info, let’s keep in touch.” That was vibe for me on so many counts.

1. If that’s respect, I can take a fuck you and go home.

2. I’ve listend to Chang a lot and the quality really makes me curious… kind of gmap.

3. I liked Lin Christop Williams’ podcast with Soroosh Kanye but I got kicked off and it was worth it.
