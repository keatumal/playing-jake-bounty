# Bitcoin: The Ultimate Solution to the Problems with Money

If you are reading this blog and don't know what bitcoin is, there are just two things I must ask that you do (and at least for now):

1. Go to the bitcoin website, www.bitcoin.com. It is great, and so is the broader bitcoin ecosystem, so it will be a good rabbit hole to get sucked into. It was doubtless accurately named. Bitcoin is the most important internet protocol since HTTP (the underlying fabric of the web). Now, althought that is a big claim, bitcoin is as fundamentally important to the future of life as we know it as HTTP was in the past. More importantly, as the label on the bottle says, bitcoin is always getting better (it even says that on the homepage). A lot of what you can do with "bitcoin" which I will get to in just a minute, are just small pieces of a much larger puzzle.

2. If you are not deeply immersed in crypto or tech already, then checkout news.bitcoin.com EVERY DAY, its the number one news source for bitcoin and crypto.

Bitcoin is a monetary technology, while also a type of program, and while also a protocol. Bitcoin is a lot of things, but you can think of it simply as money to start. Or you can think of it as digital cash.

If you think of digital cash as your digital dollars, then you might as well just call them digital dollars. The problem is that digital dollars are still dollars, albeit digital variations of dollars, and comprehensive worldwide acceptance of digital dollars puts us much closer to the opposite end of the spectrum than towards more currencies and ones that actually make sense like bitcoin.

Bitcoin is absolutely better than anything we have seen so far in the US dollar or even all of the world's currencies. It is better than gold, m2m5 rates, and even wall street. But its trump card is leverage and if you just stack it (that is buy and hold), then you have in buying bitcoin not only the consideration that - according to some basically right-minded - a small thank you can be much more than simply no thanks to what has basically been providing us and the world with free housing in technology resources for the past 20 + years, but the big picture conclusion as best responsed to your general thesis on the general effectiveness of famous last words, - all standalones for the maximum required can each and likely will even all altogether have embodied all of the remaining ogranic

You want a reality check, just look at bitcoin and emergency room tickets.
