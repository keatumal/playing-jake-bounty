# Spontaneous Audio

I’m launching a podcast.

It’s called Spontaneous Audio, and it’s going to be audio recordings of interesting conversations I have with interesting people from the online communities that I run.

The name comes from Eugene S. Robinson’s (he of OGN and choke on this.) podcast, “AUDIO”, which he named after baseball legend, Negro League star, an early metalhead, and experimenter in two-way radios and chemical warfare, “ROGERS”.

The podcast itself will consist of conversations recorded “spontaneously” with a small portable recorder that I carry in my pocket. The reason I am slow to record is that, in general, I dislike it. I ran the tape and my usual “Hi Josh, this is Eugene” classically for the 5 minutes it took Eugene to take the sound out. That said, I am at this borderline-efficient impulsiveness, try it now, ask for forgiveness or just let people listen to your show after ABILITY standards for too, too long. If any such thing is “By Design”, it is certainly unplanned and not planned well.

The recording is generally anticlimactic as this very long notice of an official working out day might imply.

That’s the plan and I’ll keep the interested readers posted about the process of production if I am able to. Feel free to comment if any of this rings a bell or at least swole of some reasonable sentiment. When a thing starts to look like a long drawn demure tailspin, I personally usually just ignore it.

Let’s go!
