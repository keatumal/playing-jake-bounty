Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Effective Pushback\n\nIt can be important to push back when someone on your team proposes a decision you believe is wrong.\n\nI recently wrote down the mental model I have been instinctively following when it comes to pushing back the right way / managing your pushback budget.\n\nMany people push back the wrong way. This can be counterproductive, annoying, and slow things down.\n\n**The right way to push back is rarely, when it matters, and when the decision might be changed.**\n\nThe wrong way to push back is often, when it doesn’t matter, and when the decision won’t be changed.\n\nI’ll address the 3 determining variables in a bit more detail:\n\n1\\. _Rarely_ — If you push back too often, the power of your pushback will be diluted so that every individual pushback becomes weakened. This is why I use the term pushback budget. It’s useful to think of it as a relatively scarce budget with negative consequences for overspending. There’s plenty of budget to push back effectively every time it is most valuable to do so — but you do not have an unlimited budget to be spent recklessly. Spend wisely.\n\n2\\. _When it matters_ — Of course, whether something matters is not a yes or no as much as it is somewhere on a spectrum, but you can roughly think of this in terms of Bezos’ Type 1 vs. Type 2 decisions — is it reversible? Big, irreversible decisions are orders of magnitude more important to get right than small reversible ones that don’t really matter. Yet you’d be surprised how commonly people push back and argue about the latter. This is a complete waste of one’s pushback budget. Save it for what matters — the irreversible and the important.\n\n3\\. _When the decision might be changed_ — It is easy to see as an objective observer when an argument passes a point where there is no chance the decision-maker is going to change their mind. The person pushing back has already presented their primary points. The decision-maker often feels as or more strongly in their original stance as they did before the pushback. Even if they have conceded a bit, it is clear they are nowhere near changing their mind. The decision simply isn’t going to change, not until after it is made and the resulting information is produced at least (this takes time). Yet some people will continue to argue and push back here. This is also a waste of one’s pushback budget. It is usually counterproductive, annoying, and slows things down.\n\nThe worst is when someone pushes back often, on things that don’t matter, beyond the point where it is obvious to others that the decision is not going to change. It’s this kind of frequent, futile, and frustrating pushback that can get a person fired. It’s unproductive, unhelpful, and wasting everyone’s time. It’s useless revolt that only serves to slow everyone down. If you catch yourself doing this, stop.\n\nAll of that said, effectively pushing back on the right issue, in the right way, at the right time, is one of the most valuable soft skills a person can develop. In a company setting, it can be company-saving. In a hospital setting, it can be life-saving. So it’s important to work on pushing back the right way, and managing your pushback budget accordingly."}]}

It seems like crypto is changing the nature of value itself. Just as the internet enabled people to easily create and share information, crypto enables people to easily create and share value. The internet led to an explosion of information. Is crypto leading to an explosion of value? \n\nInformation is infinite. But what about value? Crypto enables the definition of value where it was not previously defined. It increases the percentage of all existing value in the world that is made quantifiable and tradable. It also facilitates the creation of new value by materially decreasing the friction inherent in value creation.\n\nSo what does this mean for legacy industries where value creation is much more difficult, for companies with market caps based on multiples of hard-earned profits from “real-world” business activities? The normalized use of revenue multiples (as opposed to earnings multiples) for valuing technology companies already moved us one step away from the tangible and towards a more abstract understanding of value. Dot-com boom era multiples based on non-financial, attention-based metrics like clicks perhaps previewed an even further abstraction more representative of what’s to come. Could crypto’s impact on value do to traditional companies what the internet’s impact on information did to traditional media? \n\nThe nature of value is evolving and it is hard to wrap your head around because it hasn’t really happened yet.\n\nIt’s still just starting."}]}

I beat the sun by a solid 45 minutes and watched it rise from the highest point of Masada.\n\nMasada is an ancient fortress where a group of Jews made their last stand against the over-powered Roman Empire in the year 74 CE. After the Romans had their Jewish prisoners build a ramp up to the top of Masada (so the Jews would not kill them while they built the ramp), the Jews holding the fortress knew that they stood no chance. They decided they would rather die than live as slaves. The general instructed the men to say their final goodbyes to their families and to kill them, which they did. Since murder was forgivable (you could still go to heaven) but suicide was not, the men that remained drew rocks to determine who would be the one to commit suicide, which they did as well. Today, Masada is where IDF soldiers are sworn in after completing their basic training. The importance of never again losing control of the Jewish state is reinforced as the ceremony ends with the declaration that “Masada shall not fall again.”\n\nWe rinsed off our sweat from the hike with the salty water of the Dead Sea, entering the water from the lowest point on earth. It is 3x as salty as the ocean and you do not want to put your head under water or walk with bare feet on the salt rocks of the sea floor. The Dead Sea is no longer one whole body of water as it continues to evaporate, creating land bridges between Israel and Jordan. It is a unique experience to lean back in the water and float so easily, and the mountainous desert surrounding the sea makes it a beautiful place to be.\n\nWe closed the day with a drive through part of the West Bank where we technically exited Israel for Palestine before re-entering Israel just outside of Jerusalem. Most everything was closing for Shabbat around 3pm at the time we arrived in Jerusalem. The last few days of our trip will be spent here."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# A Guide To Getting The Sleep I Didn't Know I Needed\n\nI do not often listen blindly to expert “knowledge”, common “wisdom”, or consensus advice. Instead, I prefer to think about things for myself. That is why, after reading Matthew Walker’s excellent book,  _[Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y649387/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)_ , rather than trusting the  _National Institute of Health’s 12 Tips for Healthy Sleep_ which he recommends, I am creating my own guide to get better sleep. Make no mistake, my understanding of sleep has been for the most part informed by Walker's book. All I am doing is taking what I have learned from him and in the past and designing my own set of self-recommendations, overlapping with but significantly different from the NIH’s.\n\nI have long thought that around 7 hours of sleep was enough for me. After reading  _Why We Sleep_ , I am convinced that giving myself closer to a 9 hour sleep opportunity for 8 hours of actual sleep is probably best and that I am much better off sleeping more than 8 hours than even a little less.\n\nI previously wrote about [how to live longer and healthier](https://blogofjake.com/2020/07/02/how-to-live-longer-and-healthier/) and mentioned fasting, exercise, and nutrition as the primary tenets. After reading this book, I am convinced sleep is as powerful a factor in determining a person’s healthspan as any. As such, I am determined to systematically improve the quantity and quality of my sleep for life. Here is my guide based on my current thinking about sleep:\n\n_**Timing:**_\n\nThe first change I am going to make is to get in bed a little earlier and out of bed a little later. I will aim to be asleep in the 10’s and get up in the 7’s. If I fall asleep at 10:59 and wake up at 7:00 that is 8 hours and 1 minute of sleep minus any interruptions in the night. 10:30 to 7:30 is 9 hours minus interruptions. The latter is closer to where I will aim to be. I should note that going to bed and waking up at the same time every day is the top recommendation offered by both Matthew Walker and the NIH.\n\n_**Tracking:**_\n\nI am a big believer in Peter Drucker’s old saying, “What gets measured gets managed.” In order to manage my sleep for the sake of improvement, I must first find a way to measure it and to quantify that improvement. As such, I have ordered an [Oura](http://ouraring.com) ring to help track my sleep and plan to get an [Eight Sleep](https://www.eightsleep.com) bed once I am settled down somewhere and sleeping in the same place more than 80% of the time again (currently writing from an Airbnb in Charleston). These two products, depending on your circumstances, seem like the best two options to me. _(Click[here](https://podofjake.com/2020/08/28/5-matteo-franceschetti/) if you want to listen to my podcast with Eight Sleep's Founder & CEO, Matteo Franceschetti)_\n\n_**Drugs:**_\n\nIn order for a person to optimize their sleep, it is clear to me now that they would eliminate caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol entirely. For better or worse, I like all three of these things. That said, I have already been [conscious about consuming them in moderation](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/03/painkillers-coffee-and-the-concept-of-withdrawal-reversal/) (in lower quantities and less often). In addition to maintaining moderation in my consumption, I am going to stop having coffee after 10am on the day or two per week that I do have it. If I ever had serious trouble sleeping, one of the first things I would do would be to cut these substances entirely for a few weeks and see how that helps. Do not underestimate the consequences of coffee or alcohol just because most people drink both. Most people also do not sleep as much or as well as their health could greatly benefit from doing.\n\n_**Temperature:**_\n\nMake your room colder than you think you should – 65 degrees if you are well covered with clothes and a blanket, a couple degrees warmer the less covered you are but no higher than 69. Also related to body temperature, an underrated thing that may hurt your sleep is exercising within a couple hours before bed. An underrated thing that may help your sleep is taking a hot shower or bath before bed.\n\n_**Light:**_\n\nI will make my room as dark as possible by removing all light sources and using blackout shades or a sleep mask if need be. I will not have any screens in my bedroom except for my Kindle (importantly not an iPad). I will also put my phone and laptop away by 9pm. After considering them for years, I am finally going to order [blue light glasses](https://felixgray.com) to wear after sunset whenever I am looking at screens and maybe just generally as night glasses.\n\n_**Naps:**_\n\nI am going to continue napping more often, usually for between 20 minutes and an hour, usually not after 3pm, and especially after nights when my sleep tracker says I did not sleep as well, when I feel tired, or otherwise not 100%.\n\nLastly, there are a few things that I either do anyway or that are not relevant for me that I will note in case they may be relevant for you. \n\n  * Exercise for 30 or more minutes everyday\n\n  * Get outside for 30 or more minutes of sunlight everyday\n\n  * No late night eating\n\n  * No alarm clocks unless needed and no snooze button or multiple alarms regardless\n\n  * No prescription medications before bed that could interfere with sleep (ask doctor)\n\n\n\n\nIn closing, I have written the above guide not to be followed by myself or others in its entirety, but rather as an informal (and I should note, unprofessional) resource for myself and others to turn to if and when we want to improve our sleep from its existing state, regardless of what that state may be. I am already going to be dedicating more time to sleep itself so I do not want to spend a ton of additional time beyond that thinking about sleep and worrying about what to do to get more of it. For whatever it is worth, I think that constantly thinking about all of this stuff, especially once in bed, could probably be counterproductive in the same way that thinking about all the aspects of your golf swing while you do it can end up with your ball in the bushes. That said, I am excited to start experiencing the benefits, conscious and otherwise, of allowing myself to sleep more in general. I am also excited to start tracking my sleep with an Oura ring and eventually an Eight Sleep bed. I am going to sleep at a colder temperature, keep my screens out of my room, nap more, see if I like wearing blue light glasses at night, and consider some of the other tips that I listed above if I ever find myself wanting to do more to improve my sleep. I will also continue keeping an eye on the things that could compromise my sleep most such as a warm bright bedroom, caffeine, or alcohol. \n\nI want to share one final message based on a valuable takeaway from Walker's book which offered dozens that I have not mentioned above and which, if it is not abundantly clear, I highly recommend -- Do not drive drowsy. It can be just as bad and even worse than driving drunk and it is often deadly. I have powered through the highway drowsies myself in the past. It is not worth it. Just don't do it."}]}

It was written in the 1940’s but feels as relevant now as ever in what it says about the inadequacy of our most prevalent education systems. I have copied it below for your ease of reference. Have a nice weekend.\n\n_“Once upon a time the animals decided they must do something heroic to meet the problems of a “new world” so they organized a school. They had adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running, climbing, swimming, and flying. To make it easier to administer the curriculum, all the animals took all the subjects._\n\n_The duck was excellent in swimming. In fact, better than his instructor. But he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running. Since he was slow in running, he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running. This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming. But average was acceptable in school so nobody worried about that, except the duck._\n\n_The rabbit started at the top of the class in running but had a nervous breakdown because of so much makeup work in swimming._\n\n_The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of the treetop down. He also developed a “charlie horse” from overexertion and then got a C in climbing and D in running._\n\n_The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely. In the climbing class, he beat all the others to the top of the tree but insisted on using his own way to get there._\n\n_At the end of the year, an abnormal eel that could swim exceeding well and also run, climb, and fly a little had the highest average and was valedictorian.”_"}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Written in Stone\n\nThere is a lot of talk these days about [building](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/). I have considered the question, \"but what to build?\"\n\nIt seems natural that I would want to build something that is valuable and lasting. But then again, even the greatest castles are ultimately proven to have been built of sand. In the eternity of the universe, I am aware that all will be washed out by the waves of the ocean eventually. Still, this knowledge is not enough to stop me from wanting to build something valuable and lasting. It is only enough to urge me to consider a third factor which should be prioritized as well, that is, my enjoyment of the ride. It may be convenient then if it is true what Steve Jobs said, that \"the only way to do great work is to love what you do.\" I, for one, believe it.\n\nSo beginning with the consideration of value and longevity, how can one project the ultimate value of something that they might consider building? I actually think the common definition of lifetime value (\"LTV\") which subscription software businesses use to measure the projected value in dollars to be received from their customers over the course of their lifetimes (as customers) presents a reasonable formula, conceptually at least. Basically, I believe it is helpful to think of the ultimate value of something as the product of its _projected average value per unit of time_ multiplied by the _projected duration of its existence_ (the total units of time for which it is projected to survive).\n\nThe contrast in prioritizing one side of this equation versus the other can be demonstrated by the difference between two hypothetical builders, each of which could be connected to reality by multiple examples throughout history. The first is the epic entrepreneur who builds an amazing company without an effective enough succession plan to prevent the company's demise soon after his or her own. The second is the amazing artist whose work fails to gain acclaim within his or her lifetime but physically outlasts them and gains such appreciation in the eyes of its evolving audience that posthumously the artist and his or her work become world-renowned and persist to offer value, for example, to visitors in museums around the world. Together, the museums have given the artist's work something much nearer to immortality than was ever had by the entrepreneur's long ago bankrupt business, but some businesses do become extremely valuable for a certain period of time, and many artists never are materially discovered, before or after their deaths.\n\nTo provide a related example illustrating the nature of value, I would argue that fire may be one of the most valuable inventions of all time, not because it is insanely valuable in every instance it is used, such as to roast a marshmallow, but rather because its usage has persisted for so long and for so many fundamental purposes which could not have been achieved without it.\n\nTo consider a widespread creation that was not very valuable because of its failure to survive, Myspace may have seemed valuable to many people for a brief time, but its ultimate value in sum was compromised by the fact that the product did not endure. In fact, one could argue that Myspace's most valuable function in the end was in the way that it helped clear the path for Facebook, which again seems valuable now, but likely will seem less so in a few years, decades, or centuries, depending on how long its relevant lifetime will be.\n\nThe idea of periodic value is not limited to social media companies. Do you know how much Alcoa Steel is worth today? How about Exxon? Exxon was the most valuable company in the world just 10 years ago and today it isn't even worth half of Tesla in terms of market cap. Companies like these which were once among the largest and most important in the world are now less relevant and less valuable and may even be counterproductive in some ways by the stubbornness of their incumbency.\n\nAll of that said, it seems to me that the most persistent things which people have built in the history of the world have been architectural and written. Perhaps it is no coincidence that some of the very [oldest texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_literature) in the world are the [Pyramid Texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Texts), inscribed on the walls of an Egyptian period roughly 5,000 years ago. Perhaps it is no coincidence either that the English phrase used most often used to describe something as permanent or everlasting is to say that something is “written in stone”.\n\nPerhaps I am in need of more humbling, but the truth is that I am confident I could build a successful company if I wanted to. In the last year alone, I have probably had a dozen fundamental ideas for companies which I think would have reasonable chances to succeed. Still, I cannot help but question what the point would be if they were not to last well beyond my lifetime and if I were not to enjoy the ride more than the one I am on now -- reading, writing, podcasting, and all the rest.\n\nIt seems that if I want to build something that will last, I am doing so in this very moment by writing. It seems too that the internet has introduced a new universe of that which will last, and though the company Facebook may not, any content (like a podcast, for example) which is sufficiently spread beyond centralized platforms should survive in perpetuity as well. In the history of humanity, there may have been nothing more lasting one could do than to build with, or write in, stone. Perhaps now, the most lasting thing one can do is to write and record conversation and to otherwise build in a decentralized manner which could live possibly forever on the internet."}]}

These things include exercise, fasting, and nutrition. Within the next decade or two, I believe there will be several more things that people can do to add many more. Until those things come, here is what I do:\n\nI run 3 or more miles 5 days per week. I fast for 16 hours every weekday from after dinner the night before until after noon that day. I practice a gluten-free vegan diet on weekdays.\n\nI don’t take any pills for anything on a regular basis but there are two that I would try if I was older. I would take 1 gram of metformin and [Basis, an NAD+ supplement by Elysium](https://www.elysiumhealth.com/en-us/basis?coupon=GETBASIS&exp=21d&gclid=CjwKCAjwi_b3BRAGEiwAemPNU6wp6se4ZFJNhVxcDy9e3mLIEm1-IDFJDqqbc6PAOzHOqHuU1GJoBxoCR2AQAvD_BwE). I do take a [daily vitamin from Nutrametrix](https://www.nutrametrix.com/product/nutrametrix-isotonix-daily-essentials-packets/?id=5253595&idType=product) which is a powder that is soluble in water. Neither brand is paying for this mention.\n\nThe other things that may help me live a longer and healthier life are not things that I do but rather things that I do not do. I do not consume too much alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, or other drugs (although some damage might have already been done in the first department). I do not have conviction that any of these things are especially bad for healthy longevity but I presume them all to be better in moderation.\n\nMy habits are far from perfect but they are healthy enough that I expect to live a longer and healthier life than most if I stay the course. I could still be struck by lightning this afternoon or face something fatal that is far less improbable, but even if these practices do not guarantee me a longer and healthier life, all else equal, a healthier life is a happier one."}]}

I believe my perspective on Bitcoin is more reasonable than many of its strongest supporters and more knowledgeable than most all of its detractors.\n\nMy goal with _The Fundamentals of Bitcoin_ is to give people a fundamental and practical introduction to what Bitcoin is and why they might care about it.

I hope you enjoy this resource regarding what may well prove to be one of the most impactful technologies of our time.\n\n[Click here for free access to ](https://bitcoin.blogofjake.com/)_[The Fundamentals of Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.blogofjake.com/)_[.](https://bitcoin.blogofjake.com/)"}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Coffee & Streaks\n\nI had a cup of coffee this morning. That’s an ordinary way start to the day for [most Americans](https://www.foodbeverageinsider.com/beverage-development/coffee-consumption-hits-record-high-in-us). But it was an extraordinary way to start the day for me. You see, I hadn’t had a caffeinated cup of coffee in more than a year and a half. Last year, I wrote about [why](https://www.blogofjake.com/p/how-why-i-quit-caffeine?r=428ww&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web). Today, I am writing about why I broke that streak, and it starts with focusing on streaks themselves. \n\nStreaks are unique. They are useful because they make continuance the default whereas the opposite of whatever you are doing or not doing to continue the streak might have otherwise been the default. In this case, not drinking caffeinated coffee became my default whereas drinking caffeinated coffee might have otherwise been my default if I did not care about continuing the streak. Exercise is another good example. You might not ordinarily exercise on a day where you are extraordinarily busy, but if you have a 78-day streak going, you are probably going to find a way to make it happen that day, for the sake of the streak. \n\nStreaks are powerful because they add more relative value to the incremental continuance of the streak than that increment would have held in absolute value on its own were it not for its relevance to the streak. For example, if you miss just 1 day of exercise in a year versus missing 0 days, the difference in the percentage of days you exercised is only 0.27% (1-(364/365)), but if, let’s say, that day occurred halfway through the year, your longest streak of consecutive days exercised is cut by 50% (182/365). In that sense, the impact on the streak is ~200x as large as the impact on the percentage of days you exercised that year (50.00% vs. 0.27%), so if you’re focused on the streak as opposed to the overall hit rate, the impact of missing 1 day is 200x as important.\n\nThe psychological power of the streak is extremely useful for some people in certain situations. For example, people recovering from alcoholism or other addictions can benefit greatly from the zero tolerance policy that the outsized importance of extending a streak incentivizes. For those people in those situations, a single exception can be a slippery slope resulting in an extended relapse. It could be argued that that slope is made more slippery by the streak itself and the outsized weight that is placed on its breaking as a result of the outsized weight that is placed on its continuance, but I would give the benefit of the doubt to the idea that sobriety streaks are net positives for addicts overall.\n\nNow, coming back to why I decided to have a caffeinated coffee today, it was mostly for the purpose of breaking my streak which I felt was becoming more important than not drinking coffee actually meant to me. I still believe in everything I wrote about why I quit caffeine more than a year ago. I don’t expect my drinking coffee today to lead to a regular habit of drinking coffee in perpetuity. But basically I know now (and have known for a while) that I can quit coffee any time (the substitute habit of drinking decaf being the key to helping me do that sustainably where I had not as sustainably done it in the past). I don’t need to never have another coffee again. \n\nI believe in moderation and balance. While I still believe it is best for me personally to not be a daily or even weekly coffee drinker forever, I suspect that the occasional cup of coffee may be beneficial, even marginally, to my life as a whole. It is for similar reasons that I don’t expect to ever entirely give up alcohol even though I have generally trended towards drinking less of it over the last several years. Just like coffee, I don’t believe it is best for me personally be drinking alcohol daily (obviously) or even weekly forever, but I do believe the occasional scotch or tequila on the rocks can be beneficial to my life as a whole.\n\nIt’s funny. When I first quit coffee, I had the occasional cravings that one would expect. Even several months after, I would have an infrequent temptation – a Sunday morning on a rare vacation on a beautiful summer day with a fresh pot of coffee in the kitchen, made for the house. Most of those days I would quell the craving with a decaf. But today was not one of those days where I had a big craving or temptation. Part of the reason I felt good about breaking the streak was because I did not feel that craving or temptation. I wasn’t giving into anything. I wasn’t losing the streak. I was breaking it, intentionally, on my own terms, because it just wasn’t that big of a deal. I felt like the streak was starting to over-inflate the importance of a zero-tolerance policy towards coffee in my life. So I decided to break the streak. \n\nI enjoyed my first coffee in a long time. And I was pleased to confirm that both the taste and the ritual were indistinguishable from drinking a decaf. The difference is strictly confined to the feeling and the buzz of consuming caffeine itself. And I’m not going to lie, that made this blog post a little extra nice to write."}]}

Here’s the backstory:\n\nAs everyone knows, in 2020, the world went remote. People quickly realized they no longer had to live in the city where their office was located. So they left cities like New York and San Francisco for places with lower costs of living, better quality of life, or simply some more space — places like Miami, Austin, Denver, and smaller towns around the country and around the world.\n\nThis newfound ability to live somewhere nowhere near your office was obvious. But most people have yet to fully appreciate the second great freedom granted by the sudden shift to remote work. It’s not just that you no longer have to live in the one place where your office is located. _You no longer have to live in one place at all._**** You can live in multiple places throughout the year. You can spend several months here and a couple months there. You can live more seasonally than most humans have since we first became farmers. The only problem is that our current systems are not built to facilitate this sort of seasonal living. \n\nIf you have a mortgage or a 12-month lease and you want to go live somewhere else for a couple months, sure, you can find a long-term Airbnb, but it’s priced at a premium. More importantly, you have to continue to pay your rent or your mortgage while you’re away. This is what we call double rent. We do not like double rent.\n\nDouble rent prevents people from living the way they want to live. It stops people from being able to live wherever they want, whenever they want, because they have to pay for their place even when they’re not using it. It kills optionality and adds friction between the way you're living and the way you want to live. No more! \n\nOur objective with _The Subletter_ is to defeat the dreaded double rent. Our goal is to create a marketplace where people can post their place with confidence that someone trustworthy will step up to stay in and pay for their place while they’re away. In short, our goal is to increase the liquidity for sublets.\n\nMost generally, we want to help free people to live exactly the way they want to live. It’s a big mission, and we believe this marketplace for sublets is a big step. We hope you’ll join us in these early days by going and finding a place or listing your own at thesubletter.com.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading. We appreciate your support."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Killer Heat\n\nIt was exceptionally warm in New York City this past weekend, well above 60 degrees Fahrenheit both Saturday and Sunday. According to [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/media/okx/Climate/CentralPark/monthlyannualtemp.pdf), the average temperature in Central Park during January has been between 25 and 41 degrees Fahrenheit every year since 2000. This was obviously an extraordinary weekend in New York City.\n\nI cannot say with certainty that the temperature in New York City this weekend was a symptom of the climate crisis. It is going to be back down in the 40's this week and I am hesitant to argue that any couple of days represents a symptom of a trend when it could correctly or incorrectly just be disregarded as an outlier. Nonetheless, a weekend like this does bring people's attention to the issue, and I want to briefly touch upon the nature of that attention that is being brought.\n\nMost people do not want to think about the climate crisis for the same reason that they do not want to think about any crisis -- it is not pleasant to think about. Additionally, most people do not think that they have to think about the climate crisis because their perception is that its impacts are still a long ways away. This false perception is not helped by days like this past weekend in New York City. If the impact of climate change is simply a nice weekend in the winter followed by a prompt return to relatively normal winter weather, it does not feel like anything very bad is happening very quickly. We then have this unfortunate dynamic where the events that are triggering attention to the issue are not really representative of the issue itself and so the severity of the issue is discounted because the thing that is bringing it the attention is not at all comparable in its magnitude.\n\nIn the last 115 years, Arctic temperatures have increased 7 degrees Fahrenheit versus global temperatures which have increased only 2 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 140 years. Even in the Arctic, that change in temperature over the course of a lifetime can hardly be felt as it changes gradually year over year. It is important to recognize that the issue with climate change is not that the living temperature itself will become fatal in the near future. Rather, the issue is that these seemingly small but still accelerating rises in temperature will have catastrophic effects on humanity and overall life on earth. One of the more easily foreseeable examples will be the displacement of massive populations from coastal areas due to rising sea levels from the melting of Arctic ice.\n\nThere are a number of other reasons why the climate crisis is not getting the attention it deserves, including but not limited to the extreme complexity of the issue, its possible impacts (both direct and indirect), and the timeline on which those impacts will occur, as well as the unprecedented level of competition for people's attention that is driving humanity's inability to focus on important things.\n\nI will end for now with something that may help get some people's attention. Below is a quote from a [post ](https://continuations.com/tagged/climate+crisis/page/3)from Albert Wenger, whose [blog](https://continuations.com/) finally drew my attention to the climate crisis and whose [free book](https://worldaftercapital.gitbooks.io/worldaftercapital/content/) (which I coincidentally recommended in yesterday's post) drew my attention to the issue of the scarcity of attention itself.\n\n_\"Imagine the following scene: alien spaceships in orbit around earth, dropping nuclear bombs into our atmosphere at the rate of 1 bomb per second with the goal of overheating earth and destroying all life on it._ \"\n\nToday I read [this article ](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/world/climate-change-oceans-heat-intl/index.html)([and the study which it references](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00376-020-9283-7.pdf)) which calculates that the oceans are actually heating up at a rate of 5 Hiroshima bombs per second. The scene that Albert asked us to imagine is dangerously real. As he points out later in his post, if aliens were the cause, we would join together internationally to combat this obvious threat to the earth. Instead, humans are the cause, and only some of the world is very slowly beginning to work together to combat it. I have long said that the best thing for world peace would be for everyone to have a common enemy. This could be it."}]}

I was certainly not. It may have counted a specific notification or something.\n\nI have used my phone for less than an hour in the last week.\n\nIt’s funny. I have spent many years making intentional changes to how I use my phone — [going greyscale](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/05/consider-the-colorless-iphone/), minimizing notifications, [designing](https://blogofjake.com/2020/05/21/how-not-to-spend-half-of-my-life-on-my-screens/), and re-designing, and re-re-designing my apps and screens — and now, for the first time, I have gone a week practically phone-free, and it sort of just happened by accident.\n\nHere's what happened. I woke up last Saturday and hesitated for an instance on my initial impulse to check my phone as a part of my morning bathroom routine. The fact that I check my phone during that time was itself a result of many iterations. I used to keep my phone on my bedside table, like most people. I checked it first thing in the morning after shutting off the alarm clock app. I later decided to keep it out of arm’s reach of my bed, and eventually out of the bedroom entirely. For a while, I tried not checking it until after a certain time, at least an hour or two after waking up. But eventually, I decided a quick morning check and put away was not a bad way to start my day, so long as I did not get stuck on it for a long time, or become tempted to treat non-urgent items as urgent, or let them bother me for one reason or another. I decided to keep my phone charging in the bathroom overnight so that I could check it standing up around the same time when I brush my teeth and weigh myself in the morning. It’s harder to get stuck on your phone when you’re checking it in your bathroom standing up.\n\nSo back to the story, this last Saturday, after hesitating to check my phone first thing, I decided not to. After a couple hours of not checking it, I realized I could go the whole day. For about as long as I’ve been iterating on how I use my phone, I’ve been intrigued by the concept of a digital sabbath, or at least a phone sabbath. That would mean no phone from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday, or all day Saturday, or something like that. A weekly 24-hour fast from my phone has always seemed good and healthy. I might have done it once or twice before, but I have thought about it a lot more than I have acted on it. There is always some excuse. But this past Saturday, I had no plans, and no excuse. There was no foreseeable reason why I would actually need my phone, so I figured I’d go phone-free for the day, and I did.\n\nWhen I woke up on Sunday, I was not champing at the bit to get back on the thing. I was much more interested in the possibility of going longer without it, so I started the day that way again, and I finished the day that way again. Monday seemed like a natural morning to break the phone fast after a full weekend, but when I woke up I realized I didn't need it, so I didn't use it.\n\nTuesday arrived and I broke the fast that afternoon, after 3+ days, not because I needed to or even wanted to, but pretty much just to break it. While I didn't need it for anything, there was one thing I wanted to do with it. I wanted to get Signal (the messaging app) working on my laptop and I needed to scan the QR code using my phone in order to re-link the devices. I don’t use Signal for anyone I talk to daily, so it certainly could have waited. I also knew I didn't have any important Signal messages awaiting responses because I get the notifications on my Apple Watch. I just need to use my laptop (or typically my phone) to message back. But I used the Signal re-link as a small excuse to break the streak so that the streak would not become the main thing. I didn’t want the main thing to be to see how long of a streak I could do. I wanted to make this more than a streak. I wanted to establish with myself that I can break the streak for 10 minutes of phone time, then put the phone away again, and continue using it minimally. So that’s what I did. I used it for another 10 minutes or so each of the following days and that’s about all I’ve used it for this week (you can see in the screenshot) — less than an hour in total, and I know it could have easily been 0. Nothing I used it for was necessary.\n\nI wanted to write a bit about this because I’m pretty surprised about how it all happened. I always figured one day I could very intentionally detach from my phone when I finally cut all the ties and replaced all the things I did on my phone with alternative ways of doing them on my laptop or watch, but I did not expect it to just happen like this. So I wanted to assess how it happened, including the simple \"this happened, then that happened\" described above, but more than that, thinking about the contributing factors. I think the most important factor was that, after all these years, I was finally ready to detach, even though I didn't realize it.\n\nThinking about it now, I can see clearly that I was ready in a way that I was not a year ago. For example, it was about a year ago that I started wearing an Apple Watch daily for the second time in my life. The first time was from about 2015 to 2017. I bought the first model when it first came out for the same primary reason as I appreciate it now. I thought it could give me the opportunity to spend a lot less time on my phone. I liked it, and I wore it for a couple of years, but it did not live up to my expectations in terms of helping me to detach from my phone. The Apple Watch didn’t have cellular at the time and I didn’t realize when I bought it that it had to be within a certain range of my phone in order to serve many of the phone-related functions. I could use it around my place instead of my phone, like if my phone was in another room, but I couldn’t go out on Friday night without my phone, which was something I was hoping to be able to do when I bought it.\n\nBy the time the versions with cellular came out, I had lost interest and stopped wearing a watch altogether, but about a year ago, I bought a new Apple Watch primarily for it’s ability to passively track my fitness throughout. I got the version with cellular so that I could go for a run, track the run with my Runkeeper app, and listen to a podcast while I did it, but the cellular ended up being useful for much more than that. For example, I started going for walking calls with just my watch and leaving my phone at home. Over the course of the last year, I got more comfortable with using the watch for more and more things.\n\nAnother critical step was getting the Wallet app working. I usually carried my wallet around when I left the house until about a year or two ago. By then I realized I could use Apple Pay on my phone pretty much everywhere. I knew I could get Apple Pay on my Apple Watch as well, but I never did it because it required me to put a passcode on my watch and I didn’t want to do that. I had to put a passcode on my old Apple Watch in 2017 as a part of my employer’s policy for having work messages on there, and I ultimately stopped using the watch entirely because of that. I had to basically enter a passcode any time I wanted to use the watch for anything, which sort of defeated the purpose of its convenience. Maybe I was missing a setting back then, but this time around a fellow Apple Watch wearer informed me that I could turn on the passcode function to only require the passcode any time I put it on after having it off. Since I usually put my watch on in the morning and take it off before bed, that meant just once per day. This one-time daily passcode was no big deal compared to the every-use passcode I used to deal with, so I turned it on, enabled Apple Pay through the Wallet app, and started paying for everything using my watch. Several months later, it still feels pretty cool, especially since I'm less than a couple of years removed from carrying leather everywhere and swiping cards. I feel like I leapfrogged Apple Pay with my phone similar to how some people in developing countries leapfrogged computers and flip phones going straight to a smartphone. I pretty much went straight from swiping cards to waving watch -- no phone or wallet needed.\n\nSo, as of a few months ago, I could pay with my watch, message with my watch (speak-to-text), make calls, listen to podcasts, listen to music, check my calendar, and record notes. That’s most of what I use my phone for, but there are some other little things as well. For example, when I weigh myself every morning, I usually press a button in an app on my phone (Renpho) which logs the weigh-in so that I can track a bunch of weight-related metrics over time. Fortunately, Renpho has a simple watch app as well which has the same button. I can’t check the history and everything on my watch, but I don’t need to do that anywhere close to daily. I can just press the button on my watch, step on the scale, and boom, data logged.\n\nI thought I needed to keep my phone on me for a bunch of edge cases, like to call an Uber, but this few day phone fast motivated me to identify those edge cases and see if I could solve for them. I feel I was able to do so. With Uber, for example, you can call an uber from your laptop at <https://m.uber.com/go/pickup>. You can also use your Apple Watch to call [1-833-873-8237](tel:1-833-873-8237) and tell them your location and destination. There is an annoying little complication where they send you a code to confirm your identity, and since you don’t have your phone (you would not be doing this if you did), you have to end the call to check your texts for the code, and then call back again and give them that code. Still, it’s doable. And how many times a year will I need to call an Uber when I am by myself and not by my laptop anyway? Very few -- I don't use Uber much to begin with. If I'm with someone, they can call it and I can Venmo them, and if I have my laptop, I can call it from there. I added the link to call an uber from my computer to a bookmarks folder on my Google Chrome browser called “Phone Apps”. I added Venmo as well because I can't send those from my watch either. But I do get notifications of Venmo requests on my watch and I can easily complete them when I’m at my computer — no need for a phone.\n\nPodcasts are a little annoying so I’ll call out those as well. I use Apple Podcasts (perhaps there’s a more watch-friendly podcast app). For Apple Podcasts, you have to have the podcast pre-downloaded in order to listen, even though the watch has cellular. It doesn’t make any sense to me, but it’s not that big a deal. You just have to save or download the podcasts from your phone or computer. They’ll sync to your watch next time you charge it, and so long as you do that, they’ll be ready for when you want to listen. You have to mess with some settings in the Watch app (on your iPhone) to get it to store the maximum number of downloaded podcasts that it can, which I think is about 10 saved and 10 downloaded or something like that. After that, it shouldn’t really be a problem because you should never have a queue that is more than 10 episodes long. It actually helps a bit to avoid the choice paralysis of having too many to choose from. It forces you to be a bit more intentional about what you listen to.\n\nIn closing, I would say that being off my phone this week has made me more intentional overall. It’s made me more aware of things. And I find that there is less time in my day that gets sucked away with my knowing really what I was doing during that time. On my phone, I can often get stuck in a cycle bouncing between Twitter, Safari, and ESPN or some set of apps like that, in an endless loop, none of which is really necessary. It’s basically doing nothing while doing something or doing something while doing nothing, whichever sounds more like a waste of time to you. This week, my phone has become a tool that I keep in the drawer and use for Two-Factor Authentication when I need it, which is also pretty infrequent. I’m not sure if it will stay that way, but this week has shown me that it can if I want it to. I could use my phone even less than I use my toothbrush, which is once or twice a day for a few minutes. Don't worry, I always brush well in the morning, but brushing before bed has always seemed optional to me. Maybe I should brush more. Maybe you should use your phone less."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Escaping Negative Loops\n\nAll people have problems. One person’s problems might not seem significant from the perspective of another person, but they feel like problems to the first person nonetheless. Having problems is a part of being human. Problems are a prerequisite for solutions. We humans are great at finding solutions. Once we solve some set of problems, we identify new problems, so we can find more solutions. Jeff Bezos famously said, “customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great.” This sums it up well in a business context, but it applies more generally as well. Even the people you know who say they are happy and life is great have problems. Ironically, having problems is not a problem. It’s just a part of being human. Our inexhaustible ability to find new problems and new solutions is what has allowed us to prosper as people, and on an individual level your ability to do so is what allows you to grow as a person. Without problems, there would be no change, and without change there would be no progress, no improvement, no evolution, no growth. Humans make progress. We invent. We adapt. We evolve. We improve. That’s just what we do.\n\nStill, sometimes problems can become a bit overwhelming. There is a point beyond which they become detrimental. It is fine to be anxious, sad, nervous, or fearful, but too much of these negative emotions for too long can make for a pretty miserable life. That’s not what anyone wants. It feels better to feel positive. To take a positive perspective is a choice, but circumstances can make that choice a bit easier or more difficult. If you have are stuck in a negative loop of thinking or feeling overly anxious, depressed, or fearful, it can be hard to effectively flip your perspective to be more positive. But I have discovered a trick.\n\nYou may or may not be familiar with the power law or the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. It states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes, but often these numbers are even more extreme. For example, there are more than 2 million cryptocurrencies but just 2 of them (Bitcoin and Ethereum) comprise two-thirds of the total value of all of them. The remaining 1,999,998 combined are only half as large. This sort of phenomenon, to varying degrees, is true in a lot of areas in life. It’s useful to keep an eye out for it.\n\nI’ve noticed it applied to the things I think about as well, and that the same is true for most people. Let me offer an example. Let’s say you are feeling super down about things and have been feeling that way all week. You’re depressed, you’re anxious, and you feel stuck in this negative loop of seemingly endless fears and bad feeling and negative thoughts. It feels like the list of thing you’re worried about is never-ending. Everyone has problems, but you have more. At least, that’s how you are feeling right now. The most important thing to do in this situation is to try to identify the one, two, or three things that are most bothering you. In my experience, and in discussing with others, I find that those 1-3 things typically account for at least two-thirds and sometimes up to 90%+ of what’s the matter. It feels like it’s an endless list of things because you are stuck in a negative loop going from the first problem to the second problem to the third problem and back to the first problem in an infinite loop, and every problem feels new and different when it resurfaces, sometimes in a slightly different form than its prior surfacings. There may also be smaller problems that insert themselves in the loop and distract from the fact that there are only 1-3 problems which together represent the (vast) majority of your problems. \n\nUsually, once you recognize that you do not have a million problems and you only have 1-3 that are really bothering you, that alone should make you feel better. You can then seek to address those problems head on. If you’re three biggest problems are that you’re lonely, you hate where you live, and you are not feeling fulfilled in your job, in that order, you can call your landlord to see if you can terminate your lease so that you can move to a new town or city (let’s assume you work remotely and this is totally doable with work). You can be living somewhere new as early as next month, and you’ll feel better well before that because you’re actively addressing one of your biggest problems. To solve your loneliness problem, maybe you commit to calling one friend or family member every 2-3 days, or force yourself to go out of your comfort zone and join some club or attend some activity, or maybe you decide to get a dog. This is all hypothetical and the solutions will be highly personal depending on an individual’s situation, but you get the gist. If this person can improve their loneliness and place of living problems within a month, and further thereafter, their third-priority problem of not feeling fulfilled in their job probably won’t be enough to make them as miserable as they were when they felt like they had an endless list of problems. Now they are left with just one big one, and they can repeat the process of addressing this top priority issue head on, to clear way for lower priority problems or new problems to fill in their stead. \n\nA normal amount of problems is normal and should not prevent a person from feeling positive and happy and good about life. It’s the temporary times of overwhelmingly negative feelings that can feel hard to escape. When you’re in one of those temporary times, remember the power law. Identify the top 1-3 problems. Address those problems head on. That’s how you can escape a negative loop. At least, that’s how I do, and I’ve talked to others who have had success with this too."}]}

Generally, the California weather is great, but I would argue that, regardless of each season’s individual worth, it is the combination of the four and the transitions between each that give them value. Post- New Year’s winter is the only part I could probably do without. I think I’d like to spend those two or three months in LA some day.\n\nOn the subject of seasons, “Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter … and Spring” is a great movie that I recommend but only for people who seek films that are unpopular and unusual and give them a chance. You must be open to sub-titles at a minimum as this movie requires them. I will quote Roger Ebert rather than describing it to you myself:\n\n“The South Korean film “Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter … and Spring” (2003) is Buddhist, but it is also universal. It takes place within and around a small house floating on a small raft on a small lake, and within that compass, it contains life, faith, growth, love, jealousy, hate, cruelty, mystery, redemption … and nature. Also a dog, a rooster, a cat, a bird, a snake, a turtle, a fish and a frog.”\n\nLastly, Ebert’s fully filterable “Great Movies” section on his website (linked below) is an outstanding tool for finding a great movie to watch. I typically sort by highest rated and filter for after 1990, though sometimes I go earlier.\n\nhttps://www.rogerebert.com/great-movies"}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# No Meat Week\n\nI have never entertained let alone considered the idea of going vegetarian or vegan for purported health benefits, but for the last few years I have let the idea marinate (no pun intended) for ethical reasons. I eat meat primarily out at restaurants and not super regularly but definitely a good amount. Burgers, steaks, prosciutto sandwiches, charcuterie with red wine, pulled pork in a burrito, bacon with breakfast. Despite my enjoyment of these meats I do believe it is something I could fairly easily give up for a month, but at the very least a week, including chicken and turkey but excluding eggs and fish (allowed to eat both). I just looked this up and it would make me an ovo-pescatarian. I never heard of that but it sounds kind of cool. OVO for short. Maybe one day that will be associated more commonly with the diet than with the rapper Drake.\n\nThe reason I am writing about this subject today is because for the first time this morning I chose to eat a plant-based meat. It was Beyond Meat Beyond Sausage and I am happy to say beyond my expectations. I do not think I would have questioned whether it was real meat if someone gave it to me without telling me. This was a good place for me to start because sausage is near the bottom of the list of meats I most regularly eat or enjoy, making it the most optimal candidate for substitution. As a general believer in moderation over quitting cold turkey (with this second pun, I am realizing how heavily meats are integrated into language itself), I now think I will begin to consciously shift to eating less meat starting with the easiest opportunities and as it inevitably becomes easier to do when eating out. I say this without any desire to fully stop my meat consumption or even cut it in half at this point, but I would gladly have this sausage instead of real pork sausage at a standard breakfast spot where the sausage is just decent anyway, and I think I would enjoy it ground up in a lunch burrito if it was offered like that as well. I am not going to stop eating burgers or steaks or prosciutto sandwiches, but I can and will do better, even if it is just by 10-20%, and maybe just by doing that and writing about it and talking about it others will do a little bit better to, and the impact of small choices we know can be large.\n\nI thought about the primary reason I had not tried plant-based meat already. I had not tried it because any time it was offered I figured the real meat was already at the restaurant and if I didn’t eat it someone else would and if it was not served before it went bad it would be wasted so what the heck just give me what I’m used to eating, but that’s a poor logic to justify my human tendency to resist change. Individual by individual and instance by instance as people eat less meat, restaurants and stores will order less and suppliers will produce less and I therefore assume that in the end less animals would be treated poorly and killed. It is convenient that the best kinds of meat that people most enjoy are the high quality ones that often come from the free range, pasture raised, grass fed, no steroid, etc., more ethically treated animals. Because of that, if we can just cut our consumption of the lower quality stuff that we enjoy less anyway, we will be successful in opposition of the worst part of the problem first. Financial professionals are familiar with LIFO and FIFO methods of accounting. I will call this the WIFO method of meat replacement, the Worst Is First Out. Driven by increases in our awareness of the issues, the availability of better substitutions, and our societal desire to treat animals better, I believe there will be a significant shift in the relative near-term.\n\nLastly, I think a great idea to accelerate this transition would be to establish a “No Meat Week”. Like I said, I believe most people could fairly easily go OVO for a week. Imagine how powerful it would be if people’s small efforts to cut down on meat were concentrated within just one week, and coordinated to happen all at the same time. That would have a profound impact on restaurants and suppliers and provide a serious wake up call for the industry to shift business fast. I am sure celebrities, influencers, and relevant companies would be all over it once it got enough legs. I am not the person passionate enough about this issue to properly evangelize it, but I’ll do it myself and write about it here and tell a few people. Who knows what the butterfly effect could be. So, without any further ado...\n\n**I hereby declare the first full week of March 2020 NO MEAT WEEK**.\n\nIt is on my calendar with a location of anywhere and a description to “Go OVO”. Feel free to join me."}]}

Well, mostly. There were still some puddles leftover from the rain last night. A car drove through one of them and splashed me on the sidewalk. It got me pretty good. \n\nI took my next step and kept walking. There was not a stutter in my stride. \n\nI noticed that I was more than a little bit wet, but only from the waist down, and only on my right side. I did not turn around to see the car that splashed me. I was not at all angry or upset. In fact, the first emotion that I recognized was surprise. I was surprised that, now a few steps past the place of the splash, I had not had any reaction. This seemed unusual, hence my surprise. \n\nI became curious. I wondered why I did not react. Then I stopped wondering. It did not seem to matter why I didn’t react, but it did seem to be good that I didn’t. Negative reactions do not seem positive or productive. I don’t think anyone reacts to being splashed by a car by jumping for joy. So, in this case, the best reaction seemed like no reaction. That was my reaction, or lack thereof.\n\nWhy should I have been upset anyway? Ten minutes later, I was completely dry. Why should I have turned around to see who did it, or to yell at them, or to make arms to show my displeasure, or to make them feel bad? It was almost certainly an accident. If they noticed what they did, they probably felt bad already. What good could come from me getting mad? I couldn't think of any. \n\nI did not need to be mad. They did not need to feel bad. It was just water. I kept walking."}]}

I am sure you would agree it would be good if you got a raise today and bad if you spilled a full cup of coffee on your shirt. Still, I will argue that in reality there is no such thing as good or bad.\n\nI learned this through experience using what I believe is reasonable logic. If you had asked me before I began my freshman year of college at The University of Richmond if I wanted to have a good time or a bad time, obviously, I would have chosen a good one. If you had asked me if I wanted to be mistakenly locked out of registering for classes during the freshman sign-up period (which was already after everyone else in the school), or if I wanted to spend my first semester as the only Jew in a \"Muslim Saints & Sinners\" class and the only guy in \"Women's Autobiographies\", I would have said of course not. I have much greater interests. If you had asked me if I wanted to have strep throat a few times and a chronic cough for the year and to realize later on that it was probably because my dorm room had some mold in it, I would have had to have been crazy to see that as a good thing right? But it was.\n\nYou see, I believe in the butterfly effect, or at least the possibility of it. The way I think about the butterfly effect is that even the smallest changes can have the largest impacts. The term was coined in the 1970s from \"the notion that a butterfly fluttering in Rio de Janeiro could change the weather in Chicago.\" I reference this phenomenon because it leads me to believe that any small changes in my life, if they had played out differently, could have changed absolutely everything in the path of my life thereafter, and I strongly believe that they would have.\n\nIn light of that, if I had not had such a lousy freshman year at Richmond, I never would have decided to leave and start my own company, never would have taken the gap year that more tangibly changed my life. I never would have gone to Vanderbilt and I never would have met many of the people I call my best friends today. I doubt I would have enjoyed a semester in Florence or spent a year and a half working in San Francisco. I might not have had the same appreciation then for New York when I had the opportunity to move back about a year ago. I wouldn't have met my girlfriend, Lauren, and I wouldn't have made this blog. In fact, I can confidently say that if I didn't get locked out of my freshman registration seven years ago, you would not be reading this right now. There is just no way that could be.\n\nThe point is, you can say everything is good and bad, or you can say everything is neither good nor bad, but the fact is that the effects of any and every event are far too impactful in totality for you to possibly observe and make an accurate judgement about the goodness or badness of any event. That is why I do not believe there is such a thing as good or bad.\n\nIn practicality, I do not live by this belief in my daily life. It is a bit too far from the way things are I think, and some people might take it the wrong way and stop making an effort to do good things, be a good person, and live a good life. I am certainly not advocating for that. Like everyone else, I still hope for things that I think would be good, and to avoid things I think would be bad. There are things that I think are amazing and things that I think are horrific that are happening every day all over the world in an unimaginable number of instances, but the times when I draw on this belief are the times when things seem bad in the moment, when it might help a little bit to know and really believe that seemingly bad things can have incredibly good consequences. With this approach, I get the best of both worlds. When things seem good, I enjoy them as such, but when things seem bad I recall my freshman year at Richmond to remember that the bad things can in the end be good, and that one day I might look back and say I wouldn't have had them any other way."}]}

You generally want to focus on high leverage activities, the kind of work that may move the needle, but when in doubt, just doing a lot of work can beat overthinking it too much, sometimes.\n\nBut at a macro level, on a multi-year scale, I think spending (investing) the time to choose what to work on is extremely important, even if that time between heads down work does not feel at all productive, efficient, or even particularly directed.\n\nIt may take many months, even more than a year for the right opportunity to present itself, and you will know it is right because it will be obvious — you won’t even think about it. You will not question whether it is right. Rather, you will think about how to make it happen. If it doesn’t actually happen, then it wasn’t actually right, but don’t assume that unless/until you have properly persisted. The most right things to work on may require significant persistence.\n\nIf you’re going to work on something basically by default for 2 years, 5 years, 10 years or more, does it seem right to spend only days, weeks, or at most a month or two (8-16% of 1 year) choosing what that main thing you’ll be working on will be? I don’t think so. If it does happen that quickly, great, but most of the urgency is arbitrary and is likely to result in settling — settling in regards to the thing you’ll spend most of your life working on for the next x years. And your work life may only be 4-5x long, maybe even shorter.\n\nIt’s hard to justify this time in advance. But you have to really believe in it, because it’s not free. You’ll be burning money. Resisting opportunities. Turning down good ones because they aren’t great. You have to trust it will all be obviously worthwhile in retrospect without being able to foresee how or why or where you’ll be after this time.\n\nWithout knowing what you are going to be working on, you have to believe it is worth waiting for, and buy yourself that precious, maybe unproductive, maybe inefficient, maybe even directionless time to find it."}]}

That pressure to know only increases with time.\n\nEntering college, you are faced with a less direct but more serious version of the same question. “What are you studying? What’s your major?”\n\nIf you answered firefighter, NBA player, or actor when you were a kid, you might answer computer science, economics, or physics by this point.\n\nYou’re on the precipice of knowing what you want to do for the rest of your life, studying the subject that will best prepare you to succeed on that path. Or at least, you feel that you should be.\n\nYou enter the working world and begin your career. It’s not what you said you wanted to be when you grew up when you were a kid because it’s one of those jobs that you wouldn’t have known how to describe even if your father did it. You’re a software engineer for a human resources SaaS company, or an equity research analyst in the healthcare group at a global financial institution. No seven-year-old has ever aspired to such things. But here you are. You have a good job. You’re making good money. Your learning and you even feel at least a little useful. But something’s wrong, or so you think…\n\nThis doesn’t feel like the thing that you want to do for the rest of your life. I have some good news for you:\n\nThat’s fine.\n\nYou should not be expected to be doing what you expect to be doing for the rest of your life in your 20s or even your 30s. You should not expect to know what you want to do for the rest of your life by then either. Nor should you have known when you were entering college, nor when you were seven years old being asked what you wanted to be when you grew up, obviously.\n\nFor you to know what you want to do for the rest of your life, at least two things must be true. First, it must be true that there is something that you will do for the rest of your life starting at some point. This, in fact, is not true for a lot of people, and increasingly so as the universe of jobs and possible things to do is changing faster than ever and people’s careers are trending towards being more dynamic and evolving than ever. Second, in order to know what you want to do for the rest of your life, the thing that you want to do must be something existing and known. As such, encouraging an early answer to this question encourages people to pursue existing paths which tend to be less uniquely suited to their strengths than something less easily label-able which they might be able to create for themselves over time. Those two issues alone are enough to make this a relatively bad question, and probably not the one worth trying to answer first and foremost above all other questions when it comes to figuring you what you want to work on and get paid to do.\n\nLet me propose a different question. Rather than asking yourself at every step you take in your career whether this thing you are going to do next is going to be what you are going to do for the rest of your life, or at least has a chance to be, ask yourself the following instead:\n\n“Does this seem like a worthwhile experience?”\n\nThis includes considering aspects of the experience outside of the job itself — where you will live, what you will do outside of work, how it might impact your health, relationships, etc.. You are not looking for the end all be all here and you are not focusing on the work experience in a vacuum without considering the many other important elements in life. You’re aware that a perfect solution of something you will do for the rest of your life may not even exist. If it does exist, you’re aware that it may take a long time to get there. You’re fine with that. For now, you are simply looking for a worthwhile experience. You are looking for improvement, even it is incremental. It feels good to improve and it feels good to do things that feel worthwhile. Go for that. A life of worthwhile experiences is a worthwhile experience, and isn’t that more important than finding some societally encouraged straight-forward career to follow for your whole life? Doesn’t that sound more worthwhile?"}]}

He suggests that if we could dream any life we wanted to dream, and if we could do that over and over again, eventually, we would choose to dream the lives we are living. After dreaming lives of consistent pleasure and total pre-determination, we would choose to dream a life in which we did not have control.

That's because, as it stands, [laws are a function of latitude and longitude](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1341404085472399360?lang=en). But what if we could unbundle the age-old tie between the land and the laws? Could there be a way to achieve a fresh slate without fresh land, sea, or space?\n\nThe tie between land and laws makes complete sense in the physical world. But it makes little to no sense in the digital world. The internet is inherently global. \n\nFundamentally, laws are meant to govern how people interact, whether that’s individual people, organizations of people, or governments of people -- it’s all just people. So there was really no need for someone in America and someone in Australia to recognize the same laws a couple hundred years ago. They would be very unlikely to ever interact. \n\nToday things are much different. Many of us spend as much or more time interacting with people in the digital world as in the physical world. On Twitter, I am far more likely to meet and message with someone from Australia than I am to meet and message with someone from the apartment building that I live in — that would just be an insane coincidence.\n\nSo just like it made sense to have local laws based on the land, to set the ground rules for the interactions most likely to occur due to physical proximity, now, on the internet, it makes sense to have “local laws” for the interactions most likely to occur in the digital world, due to digital proximity. That could mean laws by platform (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), laws by cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), or laws by something else entirely, like a digital-first network state, which may acquire some land, though it will hold most of its clout in the cloud.\n\nPlatform \"laws\" and cryptocurrency \"laws\" already exist in a sense, but they are not seen as sitting at the same level as national laws. They are seen as either downstream or independent, but as the power dynamics change, so too could the power ranking of rules.\n\nIt’s a hazy view, but if you squint you can see it. The opportunity to innovate at unprecedented speeds awaits us. We simply need to effectively innovate on the way in which we regulate."}]}

Instead of being bullish on a certain market in technology, like crypto or biotech, you might be bullish on a certain market in real estate, like Miami or Charleston. The analogy doesn’t stop there, but I will stop it there for now.\n\nI was thinking about the future this morning, through a real estate lens. A roundabout train of thought brought me to a possible thesis for real estate investing which I think is both interesting and differentiated – at least, I haven’t heard of it before.\n\nThe basic idea is that it could be smart to invest in real estate in states which one can anticipate will reduce their state tax rates in the next decade or so, ideally eliminating their state taxes altogether. If you consider this factor with ignorance of all other factors, the most bullish state would seem to be Mississippi. Yes, Mississippi.\n\nMississippi has been on a path of lowering state income taxes for some time, most recently increasing the amount of income one can make without paying any state tax, and lowering the flat tax on all income above that from 5% to 4% ([source](https://apnews.com/article/business-mississippi-tate-reeves-legislature-15134876a4f232f0d7860974772d1c7f)). Moreover, the governor has promised to push for elimination of the state’s income tax entirely ([source](https://apnews.com/article/business-mississippi-tate-reeves-legislature-government-and-politics-4b2515181fbbb67d60b42c3185d8947a)). If Mississippi dropped their income tax from 4% to 0%, one would have to imagine that it would become some amount more attractive to some number of people already living in the south or elsewhere, where some percentage of those people would decide to move there as a result. With a demand increase and relatively stagnant supply, one would expect the prices to go up. Not to mention, anyone living in or looking to live in the state would have more money to spend for what they would figure to save as a result of no longer having to pay a 4-5% state income tax.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F659f986f-5e89-4d49-9215-6c07acb12ef3_681x704.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F659f986f-5e89-4d49-9215-6c07acb12ef3_681x704.png)\n\nMississippi is not the only state that one could reasonably bet on with this thesis in mind. Another state which might be more palatable to people moving from the East Coast could be North Carolina. North Carolina has been dropping its state income tax on individuals (as well as on corporations) repetitively for the last decade and plans to continue to do so for the next 5 years ([source](https://sites.ncleg.gov/frd/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/06/History-of-State-Tax-Rates_Updated.pdf)). One could speculate that North Carolina could further accelerate their plan in the same direction, or at least continue in that direction beyond the current 5-year plan, potentially on a path towards eliminating the state income tax entirely, a la Mississippi. \n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f460f30-d455-4f27-b34d-1e812baecc8e_538x359.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f460f30-d455-4f27-b34d-1e812baecc8e_538x359.png)\n\nI’m sure there are other states which might become interesting once you consider them with this thesis in mind, and I am by no means an expert on North Carolina, or Mississippi, nor state taxes, real estate, or really anything written about or contemplated in this piece – I’m just introducing an idea, and I would be thrilled for anyone to run with it however they may.\n\nFurther supporting this thesis in my mind is the more general thesis that the impacts of the sudden and significant shift to remote work that resulted from the pandemic have yet to materially play out, and rather, that they have barely even begun. As general as this thesis is, it is one in which I have high conviction. I strongly believe that big changes to the way we live and work are basically baked in for our future, but what exactly those changes will be is still very much up for debate, and depends on human actions, perhaps by people like you and me. That said, one clear change which has already begun to play out in a big way and which may be most predictable to continue has been the migration away from top tier states and cities into states and cities with better weather, more moderate governance, and perhaps more than anything, lower state taxes. This migration pattern was apparent in the first year of the pandemic and has persisted through 2023. I cannot think of many reasons I would expect it to stop or reverse, but I was able to think of one – and that’s what led to this specific thesis. \n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40296dd6-fc08-4b06-a86e-2a0618c5e018_1023x665.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40296dd6-fc08-4b06-a86e-2a0618c5e018_1023x665.png)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5e3755-8438-4ac2-83ff-c20aeff84076_1023x852.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5e3755-8438-4ac2-83ff-c20aeff84076_1023x852.png)\n\nI wondered what would happen if states like California and New York started lowering their state income taxes, and conversely what would happen if states like Florida and Texas starting increasing them. I don’t think any of this seems likely in the short term, and states like California and New York could very well do the opposite and raise their state income taxes to increase their parasitic efficiency on those residents who do remain, to make up for the losses of those who left. Regardless of whether these specific changes are realistic or not, in such a hypothetical situation, one could imagine that the migration trends as they stand today could slow and perhaps even reverse. From this standpoint, one can start to appreciate how zero state income tax states like Florida and Texas have no upside (in terms of this individual dimension only), and infinite downside, where states like California and New York have the most upside, given they have the most room to lower their state income taxes. \n\nThe practical thing to think about however is not which states have the most upside on this dimension, but rather, which states have the highest probability of realizing the largest amount of their upside in this dimension, and of doing so in the relatively near-term future. That’s where I speculate that states like Mississippi and North Carolina come into play.\n\nBroadly speaking, if you think of states as companies and their weather, schools, hospitals, and the like as the various features of their overall product, taxes are like the price, and price matters. The quality of the product determines the price that a company can charge, or the tax that a state can charge, but so does the quality of the competition. The reason that states like California and New York have been able to charge the prices (have the high state incomes taxes) that they have is because they have been objectively great states to live in -- great products. The weather in California is second to none in the country. Silicon Valley has been the tech capital of the world and Hollywood the same for entertainment. If you wanted to work in either industry, the benefits of living and working in the appropriate capital was thought to be well worth the price of admission (high cost of living, including but not limited to taxes). New York has New York City -- the same logic applies. Both states offered high quality products both in absolute terms and relative to other states, their primary competition, and so they were able to charge relatively high prices, and the people who could pay them would.\n\nThe pandemic leveled the playing field in terms of state-to-state competition in a way that is hard to overstate. Almost overnight, you could work on “Wall Street” while living on Main Street or work in “Silicon Valley” while living in Appalachian Valley, all thanks to remote work. In short, the availability of job opportunities which previously was far superior in some states and cities versus others became far more evenly distributed.\n\nThe sudden geographical redistribution of job opportunities was not the only element that changed, though it was the most abrupt. While there are many factors which remain the same, such as the weather, others unrelated to remote work are also changing. For example, cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles have become increasingly dangerous, crime-ridden, and overrun with homeless, while others like New York City and Philadelphia have reverted to \"run down\" chapters from their pasts. I’m not saying these cities are terrible. I enjoyed visiting both NYC and LA in the last few months and I am still somewhat biased as someone who grew up in the northeast to think there is no place like New York, but I’m less interested in living in these cities than I have been in the past, having lived in three of the four I mentioned before.\n\nSo zero income tax states like Florida and Texas have captured many of the outflows from California and New York. But the positive trends for these two states are obvious at this point. So I’m thinking about what’s less obvious. And that’s what leads me to states like Mississippi and North Carolina. But I’d be curious to hear what you think. Correct me where I’m wrong. Expand on my thesis if you can. Write a response blog, or comment in a tweet. We are only at the very beginning of the future, and I hope this is just the beginning of this discussion."}]}

Later, they built their own shelters from sticks and stones, animal hides and bones, and eventually, clay bricks made of dried earth.\n\nFast forward several thousand years and most of us spend nearly all of our time inside. Watching the first half of the _Jane Goodall Hope_ program last night reminded me that our nature is to be outdoors. The monkeys that were born in cages were fine in cages. That was all they ever knew. It was only once they were moved to an outdoor sanctuary that they realized there was another way to live. It was outside. It was natural. It was better.\n\nOf course, I am not suggesting that humans should return to living in trees and caves. I do, however, believe that we would benefit from spending a whole lot more time outside than we currently do. One benefit that I foresee resulting from this ongoing pandemic is that we will.\n\nThe problem is not that we do not want to go outside. Our modern systems are simply not set up for it. Our beds are inside. That is one thing that probably makes sense to keep the same, but we only spend about 8 hours in bed. There are still 16 hours left in every day. Most people spend another 8 hours or so, 5 days out of the week, in schools or offices. Our schools and offices are totally inside, but do they really have to be? Remember the days of late May and early June in school when the wishes of the students won the kindness of the teacher who agreed that they could all have class outside that day? Remember how much better those classes were? What do we need from inside that we do not have outside in order to learn or to work? We have laptops and cell phones. Is one really going to argue that there is no way to build the electrical infrastructure to get a laptop charger to work outside? The extension cord is not a very novel invention. Of course, we will want cover from rain, warmth from cold, shade from sun, and cool air from summer heat, but one hardly ever needs any of those things in a region like Northern California near the likes of Silicon Valley and San Francisco. It is just outside of these major hubs of innovation where I expect the coming movement of going outside will begin. Other regions will be right behind them. Most employees today might be lucky to get 5 or 10 rushed minutes outside just to go pickup some lunch. I believe that will change.\n\nAfter 8 hours in bed and 8 hours at work or school, there are another 8 hours in everyone's weekday. Most of these are in the evening. Outside of the weekday evening hours, there are also about 32 non-sleeping hours that most people have on the weekend. These are the hours when some people already spend some time outside, but still, the systems are not very well set up for it.\n\nMajor gym brands are in trouble and even once they re-open people will not be racing back to them very soon. People might more quickly sign up for an outdoor Equinox with intended-for-outside excercise machines and weights, outdoor yoga classes, and anything else that people might like. The sky would literally be the limit. Restaurants with outdoor seating will see those tables bounce back much more quickly than their indoor seating. Restaurants without it will want to do everything they can do to figure out how to make it work. Most people already ask to sit outside when the weather is nice and the option is available. The added safety of being less at risk of exposure to the virus is only a bonus. Last weekend, I even ran by a church that was hosting Sunday service outside. The priest was at the top of the stairs just outside of the front door of the church. The people stood and sat in front of their cars across the street. It was special to see.\n\nAs humans, we started outside. We will now be going outside again. Perhaps it is possible. Something good will come from all of this bad."}]}

Today, the markets are up because [history says the worst weeks are followed by good weeks](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/history-of-sudden-market-shocks-shows-the-market-is-due-for-a-big-comeback.html), except when they are not ([2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession)). Most everyone is hoping the spring comes faster and the coronavirus spreads slower, despite [what DJT Jr. said](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/02/28/donald_trump_jr_democrats_hope_coronavirus_kills_millions_of_americans_to_end_trumps_streak_of_winning.html).\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call  _The Weekend Miscellaneous_.\n\n[Lil Frankie's](https://www.lilfrankies.com/) \\- went here Thursday night with my brother and two cousins. It is a cool if not crammed Italian spot on 1st and 1st. Luckily we had some space in the back corner. I would recommend the lemon spaghetti, gnocchi, and pizza. The eggplant appetizer was a try and fail as I thought I was going to have some familiar help but did not. When the large wholly baked eggplant arrived at the table to be cut open, drizzled with olive oil, and sprinkled with seasoning, I realized that nobody wanted to try it but me. I did a respectable job and it was reasonably tasty but I am not in the business of eating whole eggplants, especially not when there are pizza and pastas on deck.\n\n[The Big Sick](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B072F29NCZ/ref=atv_dl_rdr) \\- finally got around to watching this movie with Lauren over the weekend. I thought it was good and well acted by Kumail Nanjiani who is now [jacked](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/16/entertainment/kumail-nanjiani/index.html), Ray Romano who is now back, Zoe Kazan who plays Kumail's real-life wife Emily, and her mother in the movie who Lauren sniped as the voice of Elastigirl in _The Incredibles_. The movie was not incredible, but it was well worth a watch.\n\n[Violet ](https://www.violeteastvillage.com/)\\- went to this months-old East Village spot from the owners of _[Emmy Squared](https://www.emmysquaredpizza.com/) _and _[Emily](https://www.pizzalovesemily.com/about-us/)_ with Lauren on Friday night and split an outrageously good \"grilled\" pizza and a burger. The pizza dough was grilled on both sides as advertised with fontina, truffle sottocenere (fancy cheese), pistachios, and honey on top. It was as much cheesy bread as it was pizza but it was absolutely delicious. They give us a big pair of scissors to cut it with which may be fun for some people but I would have been fine if they saved us the step. The burger which we ordered medium came out objectively rare but it was still very tasty with caramelized mushrooms, cheese, and bacon. It is easy enough with a steak or a fish to send it back if they get it wrong to be cooked some more. With a burger, however, the kitchen really has one shot to get it right because once it is all done up with the toppings and everything it really has to be a problem to become worthwhile making a fuss about. We ate it as it was and that got me the rarer part of Lauren's half so I had no complaints and would go back for the pizza alone.\n\n[Pasquale Jones](https://www.pasqualejones.com/) \\- known to have some of the best pizza in the city, I made a Saturday brunch reservation for 4 when I found out my buddy Jack who I worked with out in San Francisco was going to be in town up from DC for the weekend. We split a bottle of red, a salad, and a bowl of agnolotti (small ravioli) as a table. Jack and Sam split a spicy pepperoni pizza and Lauren and I split one with mushrooms. The pizza was great as expected but the waiter's expressed certainty in the fact that it was the best pizza in New York was a bit off-putting to me. There is a sense of humility that I believe can be an important element in being the best, so if someone says they are the best, they probably are not, not in my book at least, most of the time. I liked the music very much from Jurassic 5 when we walked in to Big L when I used the bathroom and even the lesser known People Under The Stairs later on in the meal. We talked about Kobe, San Francisco, and the concept of destiny.\n\nFamily Sunday - my parents came in on Sunday for brunch with Sam and I and to see our apartment for the first time. We met them at The Crosby Hotel which was a bit artsy and posh for my usual taste but a great spot for family brunch nonetheless. We ended up hanging out through the afternoon and had a bonus meal in the form dinner at [Lupa](https://luparestaurant.com/), which is one of my very favorite places for pasta in all of New York. We split the cacio pepe and the short rib ragu along with a chicken dish which looked good enough at the table next to us to convince us to stray from strictly pastas.\n\nToday is the first day of [No Meat Week](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/28/no-meat-week-1st-week-of-march/) for me, and maybe the first or second day for you too. Thankfully, I had plenty of great meals this weekend to last me through the next several days on smoothies, rice, beans, frozen bags of vegetables, and all of the other boring but indubitably healthy groceries that I eat during the week. I am conscious of the fact that after only three posts of the _The Weekend Miscellaneous_ it has pretty clearly become a food and sometimes movie review outlet. I believe this may morph over time, and I may sooner or later do away with _The Weekend Miscellaneous_ altogether, but for now, like everything else that I write, I hope some people can find some way in which it is useful and/or enjoyable, just as it is for me."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Bitcoin’s Belief System - The Driver of Value\n\nOne of the most fundamental reasons why I believe that the value of Bitcoin will continue to appreciate is because it is much easier for people to start believing in it than it is for people to stop.\n\nBitcoin believers tend to believe in it strongly and sometimes even irrationally. For many people, it is like a religion. For many more, Bitcoin has a continuous influence on their way of life not dissimilar to other modern systems of belief such as climate change and veganism. To varying degrees, Bitcoin believers will weather potentially any storm (decreases in its value, attacks in the media, etc.). Qualitatively, Bitcoin believers are quite strong.\n\nQuantitatively, outside of Bitcoin’s still relatively small base of believers, there are many more people who do not sufficiently understand Bitcoin than there are people who do understand it but do not believe in it. If the last decade is any indication, a certain and probably high percentage of those who do not yet understand Bitcoin will quickly and easily come to believe in it once they do.\n\nHaving observed these dynamics of the Bitcoin belief system, I am near certain that non-owners are coming to believe in Bitcoin faster than owners are losing their belief. In other words, the outside population is buying into Bitcoin faster than than the inside population is selling out. This trend seems poised to continue indefinitely. As long as it does, so will the appreciation of Bitcoin’s value due to the increasing demand for the limited and finite supply.\n\nOne can think of Bitcoin as having a natural network effect where the owner population is expanding exponentially in comparison with an extremely low churn rate among its existing owners. It is this sort of network effect that has given rise to the most valuable companies of our time. Bitcoin is not a company but it stands to benefit just the same.\n\nQuants can do all the fancy analysis they want but the simple fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is worth nothing without people’s belief in it. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, its value will plummet. If more people start believing in Bitcoin, its value will continue to appreciate. Because Bitcoin’s value is sustained solely by people’s belief in it, it seems to me that any prudent investor who makes a bullish case for Bitcoin should seek to support this most basic underlying assumption which says that the overall belief in Bitcoin is growing and will continue to grow. That is the assumption which I have sought to support with this piece. \n\nIn closing, it is worth stating clearly that money has no real value other than that which people believe it does. As long as people believe Bitcoin is valuable, it will be. Today it seems evident that Bitcoin believers are quickly accumulating and scarcely abandoning the asset. So long as this continues to be the case, and it seems more probable that not that it will, Bitcoin’s value will rise."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Request for Startup: Harmless Vape\n\nI often have ideas for products which I wish existed but do not want to create myself. The reason I do not want to create them myself is not because I think they are bad. It is because I appreciate the intensity and duration of effort that goes into building a successful startup, and I am not going commit myself to doing that [until I know I absolutely have to](https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1276723910185291777?s=20). So long as I am not going to build these products myself, the next best thing I can do is to share the ideas so that others may steal them. Perhaps I might have the ability to advise these people along the way and eventually invest once I have more money and am able to do so. By this logic, I may begin more frequently posting some ideas on the blog with titles as exemplified by this post beginning with the phrase, \"Request for Startup:\".\n\nToday, I would like to put out a request for a harmless vape, like a JUUL but without the crippling addiction to nicotine that comes with it. Some products related to this idea do exist from [oxygen inhalers](https://www.amazon.com/Smoking-Chewable-Cravings-Fixation-Support-Relief/dp/B07R7NCRXB) to [aromatherapy vaporizers](https://monq.com/), the latter of which I have tried, but I am somewhat unsatisfied with the existing options. I am glad these products exist and they are better than nothing but they are not popular like JUUL or like smoking cigarettes and that is primarily because they are not cool. Perhaps it is true that a product like this simply can't be cool and never will be, but I am not so sure.\n\nThe reason I want this idea to exist is because I would use it and because I believe others would too. There is a pleasure in smoking that those who have never tried it may not appreciate, but I think it comes as much from the act of smoking itself as from the actual substance being smoked. That is not to say that the substance has no impact on the experience (of course it does), but I think if someone can create something potent enough to create a nice head-rush or occasionally a fleeting sense of euphoria from an at least harmless or at best beneficial vapor, people would dig it. The problem with the existing options is again that they do not feel like they do much and they aren't particularly cool.\n\nIt bears repeating, my idea rests on the assumption that the sensation of smoking is not just about the substance itself. It is about sitting outside a café or on a park bench or even just on the side of the street, enjoying a low effort and somewhat sensational activity so that you may let your attention wander to the things in your surroundings as you do it.\n\nConsider Georges Seurat's famous painting,_A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte_ , pictured below.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ba389a6-6901-4202-a224-5de52ea1b977_700x471.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ba389a6-6901-4202-a224-5de52ea1b977_700x471.jpeg)\n\nNo one is smoking but you could imagine they could be. In a world where we have infinite \"entertainment\" on our phones, it has quickly become unusual to see someone simply standing or simply sitting, just thinking or observing the world around them as in the painting above. Today it looks quite odd to be sitting on a park bench without looking down at your phone or at least listening to something through your headphones.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fdb652a-2a77-4850-9a3d-7b4053db746e_1024x640.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fdb652a-2a77-4850-9a3d-7b4053db746e_1024x640.jpeg)Who looks like he might be a weirdo? The guy on his phone or the guy behind him?\n\nThis morning, I was on a walk and took a break to lean against a guardrail on the side of the street. I noticed a wave of self-consciousness come over me as a car drove by. \"What could he possibly be doing? Is there something wrong with him?\" All I was doing was sitting there, like the people in the painting, listening to a stream, not of music through my headphones, but of water flowing behind me, and to the birds chirping from branches above. I saw the snow all around me and watched two deer venturing through the woods. I enjoyed the cold winter air and watched the steam of my breath as I exhaled. I realized, had I been smoking, I might not have looked as unusual, but rather cool.\n\nIt would be a tall order to request that we rewire the cultural consciousness to see someone doing nothing out in public and think of them not as unusual but as cool. The easier thing to do is to give people something innocent to do so that they may not feel hesitant to go sit in the sun for an hour. Perhaps a harmless vaporizer could allow people to do such a thing more comfortably, and could prevent others still from picking up a cigarette or a JUUL instead. This isn't the most revolutionary idea and I feel somewhat silly making it my first explicit request for a startup, but the fact of the matter is that I would like to see a better product of this kind than is currently available to me. Perhaps something about this idea resonates with you. Perhaps you can make it happen."}]}

I [googled ](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&sxsrf=ACYBGNQEcRt1omsEzPLc5p2Cp3ezxUuzgg%3A1580349595885&sa=1&ei=mzgyXuLXNaWeytMP6fKwiAE&q=don%27t+worry+about+what+you+can%27t+control&oq=don%27t+worry+about+what+you+can%27t+control&gs_l=img.3..0l2j0i24.719712.721297..721426...1.0..1.208.947.7j2j1......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......35i39j0i7i30j0i30.yycmJlZS0uI&ved=0ahUKEwiikaKCnarnAhUlj3IEHWk5DBEQ4dUDCAc&uact=5)to see if there was an originator of the quote to give credit to and it came up as Tim Tebow. I am doubtful that he was the first to say it.\n\nNonetheless, I think this is generally a good rule to follow. It sounds simple enough, but the hard part is determining the lines between what you can and cannot control.\n\nFor instance, if I am negotiating for a house and it is listed for $10 but I really want it for $9 even though it may already be the cheapest house in the world ([actually it is not](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-one-euro-home-websites/index.html)), I cannot control your willingness to sell me the house at my desired price. That said, it is hard to argue that I could not influence your willingness based on my ask or method of negotiation or a number of other things which I can control. To demonstrate, if I were to say, \"I will buy the house for $10\", it is safe to say that my chances of getting it for $9 would be lower than if I were to say, \"I can offer you $8\", in hopes of receiving a counteroffer. It is important to note that I cannot control your decision but I can influence it through choices that I can control. By Tebow's rule, I should not worry about your decision, but rather, about my choices that could influence it. That sounds like a sound approach to me.\n\nA less ambiguous example is the infinite number of things that have already happened in the past. I cannot imagine a good argument to suggest anyone could control the past, but you can certainly control how you choose to move forward from it, or even how you choose to remember it. You may not be able to change what actually happened but you can control choices which can change some of the influences that come from the results of the past.\n\nDespite the fact that we often lack absolute control, we have these constant choices that we can make every day which can influence things or change the influences that things have, on ourselves especially. I believe that we (myself included) forfeit most of these choices to the [defaults ](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/17/dmvs-and-defaults-that-quietly-drive-decisions/)of the systems that we live in, while at the same time, we suffer from wishful thinking that we can control a lot of things that we cannot.\n\nIn short, I think we tend to underestimate our choices and the power that they can have while overestimating our control over things we cannot have any over. I might even go so far as to say that our control is limited exclusively to our choices, but our choices are so expansive that we mistake the impacts and influences that they can have for illusions of control.\n\nA good rule of thumb, I think, is to focus on the choices we have when we feel the need to change something that is out of our control. You may not be able to change that thing, but you can change something."}]}

The hacker started by selling already in-use Twitter handles for hundreds or thousands of dollars. They then began the \"send me Bitcoin and I will send back double\" scam, first through crypto-related accounts like Binance, Coinbase, and Gemini, and soon after through celebrity and company accounts with large followings including (in chronological order) Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Apple, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Joe Biden, Warren Buffett, Barack Obama, Floyd Mayweather, and Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe hacker made the vast majority of their money through the last part of the scam, much less than that through the crypto-related accounts, and even less than that by selling the usernames in the beginning. It seems like the improvised work of an amateur, but if that was the case, why haven't they been caught yet? If the hacker was no dummy, his scams seem odd contrasted against his ability to have hacked Twitter. One possible explanation could be that the opportunity for the hack was spontaneous and the hacker had little or no time to plan the scam. Another could be that the hacker had reason to believe this scam would generate much more money than it did and that it simply failed to do so. Perhaps the perpetrator was a Twitter employee who did not need to hack anything at all to pull this off, but again, it seems to me that someone like that would have been caught already.\n\nThere is, however, another possible answer that does not solve the question posed in the beginning of this piece but rather leads to the asking of additional difficult-to-answer questions. What if the hacker's goal was not to make money through the obvious scam? If that was the case, what could their ulterior motive have been? In considering this question, it is helpful to think about the impacts of the hack outside of the relatively low number of bitcoins that changed hands as a result of it.\n\nFirst, this is not a good look for Twitter. This is not the first case where Twitter has been hacked and it is the worst case where Twitter has been hacked. As of this writing, there has been no definitive message from the company to suggest that this issue has been fully resolved and that the hacker has lost any and all control. Until that announcement is made, I will consider this an ongoing incident. It seems possible though probably unlikely to me that there could be more damage to be done.\n\nSecond, this is a point for decentralization and a strike against centralization. In this incident, Twitter, a centralized system, was hacked to conduct an unpunishable crime using Bitcoin, a decentralized system. It demonstrates the vulnerability of centralized systems where unfathomable amounts of control lie in the hands of one company or even a single individual. It also highlights the uncensorable nature of a decentralized system where there is nothing that anyone can do to confiscate money that is transacted or to reverse any transactions that were at one time agreed upon. It is important to recognize that all of the money that people lost in the scam was money that they gave away by their decision, regardless of how soon they later came to regret it.\n\nThird, this counterintuitively helps further legitimize the value of Bitcoin, even though it was used to facilitate a significant scam. It speaks volumes about the security of Bitcoin that someone went and hacked one of the largest social media platforms in the world in an effort to steal some. If Bitcoin was hackable, one would have expected a hacker who wanted some to go and steal it directly from people's wallets. Considering the hacker could have made more money by stealing a few relatively small Bitcoin wallets, why would they go to such great lengths to hack the entirety of Twitter instead? It is only reasonable to conclude that Bitcoin must be significantly more difficult to hack. Separately, this sends a loud message that the most impressive hack in recent memory was executed in an effort to steal Bitcoin. In other words, the hacker had the opportunity to send a message through trusted celebrity profiles with hundreds of millions of followers around the world and what was the message that they chose to spread? \"Please send Bitcoin.\"\n\nSince I still have many more questions than answers, I will end by sharing several of them. What if the hacker's main objective was not to make money but to destroy people's trust in Twitter? What if it was to send Twitter's stock crashing down in the near-term and the company down with it in the long-term? What if it was only to demonstrate the dangers of centralized systems? Could this have been a noble act to prevent the possibility of more dangerous hacks by bad actors in the future? I am not saying that it was by any means, but could it have been? What if the hacker sent back all of the money they received from the scam? What if they actually sent it back doubled like they said they would? How would that effect the reputation of Bitcoin? How would that effect the price? Why haven't the prices of Twitter or Bitcoin moved any more than on the average day as a result of this event? Doesn't that seem a little odd? Did the hacker expect these prices to move one way or the other? Was that a part of their plan? Is the hacker not done yet? What else don't we know about? How much could the hacker have made by searching and screenshotting a few celebrity DMs and blackmailing them with that information? Why did the hacker make this such a public event? What if they just hacked it to show that they could? What if the hacker was some Twitter employee's teenage brother or sister or kid? What if they just hacked it for fun?\n\nThere are countless questions left unanswered and I do not know if any of them ever will be. The most likely scenario remains that _The Blue Check Hack_ simply was what it seemed to be, an impressive hack that resulted in an unimpressive scam. Still, it is interesting to think of the possibility that something else may have happened here or that something may still be going on."}]}

I watched his first two few-minute stints of underwhelming playing time before boring of what was at that point a one-sided game between two non-playoff teams.\n\nIt turned out that I turned off the TV too soon. Zion dropped 17 consecutive points in just over 3 minutes at one point in the 4th quarter. According to [Elias Sports](https://twitter.com/EliasSports), he achieved records for the most consecutive points scored by a rookie in the 4th quarter (17), the most 3's made without missing in a player's debut (4), and the most points scored in under 20 minutes in a player's debut since the shot clock was invented in 1954 (22).\n\nBased on the records or headlines alone, one might assume Zion's debut was near perfect. People who believe he was the best player in last year's draft might even prematurely say \"I told you so\". Ultimately, everyone should know that one game is not nearly enough to determine how a player's career will be, but that will not stop some people whose thesis on Zion was supported by his debut from citing it as such.\n\nThe misleading part about using the headlines and the records as support in this instance is the means by which Zion accomplished the stats. He did not score 17 points in 3 minutes using his absurd athleticism, combination of speed and size, or jumping and dunking abilities, spare one impressive alley-oop layup. The rest of his 17 points were comprised of making 4 wide open 3's, 1 of 2 free throws, and a put back layup from his own blocked shot.\n\nDo not get me wrong. It was an exhilarating [few minutes of play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV4OVJd_ddI) to watch and I was happy to see Zion take over the game. At the end of the day, the numbers are the numbers and no matter how you put them up they are impressive. Still, this was not \"Zion being Zion\" to put up those numbers. This was Zion knocking down wide open 3's, making one Zion type play (the alley-oop), one hustle play (the putback), and missing half of his free throws (an issue that could become significant for him in the future if not improved from the 64% he shot from the line in college). Speaking of college stats, Zion made 33.8% of his three point shots in college, a rounding exercise from LeBron's 34.3% shooting from beyond the arc this year. You certainly do not see teams giving LeBron wide open looks from 3, let alone four of them in a row. Sufficed to say, teams will know to guard Zion from 3 point land after last night.\n\nI am not making any predictions about Zion's career. Contrary to the sentiment of my writing to temper what I believe is a somewhat unwarranted level of hoopla around his debut, I am generally optimistic about what his career will look like. I do think that, barring injuries, Ja Morant will end up being the best player from the 2019 NBA Draft, and I am skeptical about Zion's ability to be \"the guy\" on a championship team, but only time will tell. For now, I am rooting for Zion, Ja, RJ, and all the rest of these young players. I am looking forward to hopefully seeing a lot more of them in the playoffs in years to come, when I tend to watch a lot more NBA basketball than I do during the regular season."}]}

But he was not the only one who believed so strongly in this philosophy...\n\nIn the business world, consider this quote from Jeff Bezos: \"We believe that focusing our energy on the controllable inputs to our business is the most effective way to maximize financial outputs over time.\"\n\nAnd in the sports world, the greatest basketball coaches of all-time at both the college and high school levels agreed, almost verbatim:\n\nJohn Wooden: \"The score will take care of itself when you take care of the effort that precedes the score.\"\n\nMorgan Wootten: \"Be concerned with process and the results will take care of themselves.\"\n\nWalsh famously taught the receptionists the right way to answer the phones.

A lot of people desperately want to get into it, but a lot of people who are in it desperately want out. People want in because it pays very well, you learn a lot quickly, and it opens a lot of doors. They want out because, once they are in, those doors are opened and through them often awaits a better balance of high pay, more enjoyable work, and reasonable hours. I always considered myself very fortunate to get a job in investment banking, let alone doing technology mergers and acquisitions for a great firm. I was still (and remain) very grateful for my 2+ years there between San Francisco (18 months) and New York (9 months), but a few months ago, at the end of September, I decided to quit.\n\nI quit for a variety of reasons. When I told one colleague from another office that I was quitting without my next job lined up, his assumption was quick. He said, \"You must really be pretty miserable then. Hey, I can't blame you.\" But that wasn't the case. I didn't love working well into the AMs some weekdays or being on call all the time and often having a lot of work to do on weekends, but I was not working 100 hour weeks spare maybe 2 or 3 over more than a hundred weeks in 2+ years. Sidenote: A lot of people in banking exaggerate their hours, but 70-90 real hours is still a ton and about as high as any person would want to go, trust me. 100 hours requires, for example, 10AM to 2AM Monday through Thursday (64 hours), 10AM to 10PM on Friday (12 hours), and another 24 hours however you want it (you don't) on the weekend. Like I said, I only had 2 or 3 of those weeks and they sucked. The guy who assumed I was miserable probably knew I was not getting killed that badly but he figured I was fed up with dealing with a couple of particularly tough senior bankers. That was not it either. I have a pretty high tolerance for dealing with that sort of stuff so long as I have my reasons to do so. The truth was that there was no real reason why I was miserable because, like I said, I wasn't. I felt very fortunate to have the option to continue doing what I was doing, but also, to have the option not to.\n\nA lot of people take their first job after banking more because they want to get out of banking than because want to get in on whatever they are getting in on. They are often objectively great opportunities and no one usually questions why people take them except for the people themselves who cannot help but wonder if it is just another short-term step in some direction towards an ambiguous vision of a better life where \"work\" is enjoyable and life is better. I have never believed in \"destination happiness\", the concept that if I can just get this or have that I will be happy. Don't get me wrong, I believe in the value of making sacrifices and paying your dues, but not on an infinite timeline. After a couple years of abnormally hard work, I looked at my situation from a neutral point of view, crucially ignoring the illusion of the default which told me that I should stay at my job unless I had a clear and obvious reason to quit (like a next job lined up). I knew by this point that I did not want to rise through the ranks in typical investment banking fashion, so rather than stay until I found something else to do, I decided to quit and do anything else I wanted to do.\n\nI appreciate the fact that I was very fortunate to have the freedom to make this choice. In 2+ years I had worked more hours than many of my peers would work in 3 or 4 years at their jobs, and as such I had earned income at a pretty disproportionate rate as well. I had saved enough money (outside of a relatively illiquid real estate investment) to comfortably buy myself at least several months of living without working in New York (or several years in Thailand, India or Vietnam, not that I wanted to do that). I had recently received my second year bonus and so with virtually no additional bonus money accrued (earned but unpaid), I could quit without feeling like I was leaving any earned money on the table (I would argue the bonus structure for junior bankers would be gone if not for its usefulness as a mechanism to trap solid bankers into rising through the ranks). Two of my three major deals had just closed and the third had just passed a critical checkpoint so I could effectively leave without screwing my deal teams. My lease was up at the end of the month so I was not tied to any large recurring payments (rent) and I would be free to travel wherever I wanted and I could even do so for a lower cost of living than my rent alone. A lot of people say that with a lot of things the timing will never be right and so you just have to do it. Fortunately for me, in the case of quitting my job, the timing was just right, so I quit.\n\nI spent my first week without a job at home with my family in New Jersey. The next week Lauren and I had a week-long vacation in Praiano, Italy (an awesome little town between Amalfi and Positano on the Amalfi Coast). When we booked our flights a couple of weeks prior, I chose to buy a one-way ticket. I decided on my next destination our last night in Italy and spent the next week in Paris. That was followed by a few days in Copenhagen before flying to Tokyo for a few weeks traveling through Japan with my buddy Eric who was a couple of months into a year-long trip of traveling the world. I had some luck while I was traveling in that my investment in Tesla was literally paying for my travels as I went (part of why I sold too soon). Eric is currently a few continents in on his goal of running a marathon on all of them and so after training on his schedule for a bit I was in the best shape of my life running 30 mile weeks soon after Japan. I was home by Thanksgiving and started this blog on the 1st of December. I took the time to discover my interests and define my purpose. I started learning about big things like climate change and crypto. I applied for three amazing opportunities in VC, all of which I came across organically while following my interests, and one of which I have an interview for next week. I read some books, a couple of which I did not want to put down, and with my total freedom of time, I did not have to (recommend World After Capital by Albert Wenger and The Fixer by Bradley Tusk). As you already know if you have been reading the blog, I spent 10 days in Israel, celebrated New Years Eve in Tel Aviv, and now I am back home with a few more exciting things up my sleeve. This week (Sunday dinner through Friday lunch) I am going to try to eat vegan and gluten-free... we'll see.\n\nThis blog is and will always be for me if no one else. It forces me to write every weekday and to have something interesting to write about and to do that I have to live a somewhat interesting life and learn about interesting things. I like that this blog serves as a public record and I sincerely hope that over time, more and more people read what I write and find it to be valuable or enjoyable to read, if not both, but at the very least, it is for me. This post is no different. My motivation to write it was to think about my response to the inevitable questions I will get about why I quit my job and how I have spent my time since. There are better and worse ways for me to craft an honest answer but the truth is so simple that it does not require any crafting at all. There were all of the reasons I mentioned and more for why it made sense for me to quit, and there were all of the things that I mentioned I have done since and more that have made me glad that I did, but when I throw my pros and cons paper in the garbage and let go of my need to justify my decision to quit, the answer is simple and clear. It all just feels right."}]}

It was hosted by one of the group leaders from the birthright trip that I went on and we had a dozen or so people from the program together in her apartment on the Upper West Side, a couple blocks from the northwest corner of Central Park. We had one guy visit from Israel and another couple of people up from DC so I felt very fortunate once again to live in New York where it sometimes feels like everyone is and everything happens. As I wrote previously about [Shabbat](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/28/shabbat/), I have come to believe it is an excellent concept when afforded a little flexibility. This first experience only further cemented my perspective. We ate great home-cooked food including challah, vegan curry, and kugel which is like a Jewish version of mac and cheese only a little sweeter thanks to some sugar and cinnamon. We talked about the highlights of our weeks, drank wine and beer, and ate chocolates filled with brandy.\n\n[Tompkins Square Bagels](http://tompkinssquarebagels.com) \\- a long line worth waiting in for an excellent bagel toasted with cream cheese. For such a line, one has to be impressed by the efficiency of their system. We were in and out within 10 or 15 minutes and there must have been 75 people inside. I looked at the several different variations of cream cheese and wondered who was ordering all of them, particularly the cookie dough. My only critique is that they are a little light on the everything seasoning for their everything bagels. That said, I grew up spoiled in terms of bagels having had the locally legendary [O’Bagel](https://www.obagel.net) just a few minutes away from my house in New Jersey. Regardless of particulars, TSB will satisfy a bagel craving any day of the week(end).\n\n[John’s](https://www.johnsof12thstreet.com) \\- this neon sign between the blocks where my buddies Will and Harry live has intrigued me for a while. The three of us finally got to going on Saturday night and it was exactly what I had hoped it would be. No frills Italian food with an old-school vibe and excellent service, all conducive to a great time. We started with an order of buratta and an eggplant parm to share, complimentary garlic bread served alongside it. We followed with the Spiedino Mozzarella Romana which was basically a giant mozzarella stick sliced into french toaster stick sized slices and soaked in a butter and anchovies sauce which made the whole thing taste a little fishy and a lot salty, but in a much tastier way than those words might seem to suggest. We also had a penne with mushroom sauce but what sealed the deal was the cheesecake dessert. When it comes to desserts, I usually tend towards chocolate and I will take a tiramisu over cheesecake nine times out of ten. When the service is good, however, I will relinquish my preferences in favor of the waiter’s recommendations and so by that means only I have had my fair share of cheesecakes. John’s cheesecake was the best I have had. It was cakey and chilled and just unbelievably delicious. Our waiter Tony was great all night to the point where we somewhat expected him to bring limoncello shots with the check. Even better, he brought complimentary and generous second pours for the ports we had enjoyed with dessert. Tony told us how everything was made in house except for the ice cream in the tartufo, including the cannolis which were “good” he said, but the ones on the next block at Veniero’s were “great”. That is the kind of humility I like to see at a restaurant.\n\n[Veniero’s](http://venierosnewyork.com) \\- sure enough, I went and tried the cannoli on Sunday. It was great.\n\n[Café Mogador](http://www.cafemogador.com) \\- went out for breakfast with my brother on Sunday before the brunch crowds got out of bed. I love waking up after most kitchens are open but before most people are up on the weekends. There is no better time to enjoy a breakfast out. This Middle Eastern spot on St. Marks served a nice breakfast of eggs, hummus, tabouli, and salad with seasoned pita bread on the side. There was a spicy sauce served also on the side which was tasty if you could handle the kick, which if I could, you probably could too. In many towns, this could be a go to spot for me. Here it is just one of many within a few blocks.\n\n[East Village Pizza](http://www.eastvillagepizza.net) \\- grabbed a slice in the late afternoon on Sunday to tide me over until dinner after skipping lunch. I ordered a plain slice but audibled to a margherita when I saw it come fresh out of the oven. The switch cost me a buck twenty-five but I could taste the premium ingredients that I paid for. It was a solid 7 slice held back mainly by its mediocre crust.\n\n[Mimi Cheng’s](https://www.mimichengs.com) \\- great dumplings filled on the spot and served fresh and hot. Six or eight pieces, boiled or pan-fried made for an easy choice of eight pan-fried dumplings for me.\n\n[1917](https://www.amazon.com/1917-George-MacKay/dp/B082MQMWV7/ref=nodl_) \\- saw this in theaters Sunday night with my brother. I continue to be surprised by the quality of movies that were produced in 2019. I loved Parasite, The Irishman, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and while Joker was hard to love, it was easy to appreciate. 1917 I thought was remarkable in the way that it was filmed seemingly without any cuts. You basically had to pick a point within an almost perfectly seamless transition from one scene to another and guess that there was a cut somewhere in there to try and find one. The acting was excellent from the main two characters to the others with briefer roles including the guy who gives them the flare and the single scene appearing eldest of The Stark Brothers from Game of Thrones. My brother argued that it was a better film than the most natural comparison, Saving Private Ryan. We eventually came to an agreement that, although it may have been better technically because of the quarter century’s worth of technological improvements that the 1917 team had at their disposal, it was not necessarily fair to compare the two overall. That would be like comparing the recent Warriors dynasty to Jordan’s Bulls. They may have dominated the same sport, but the game had changed.\n\nI hope people stay healthy this week and that the warm weather today is here to stay."}]}

One of my principles is that definitions are limiting. As such, I hesitate to even identify as a principled person, but I know it is generally true.\n\nAs a person who believes in principles, I tend to admire other people who are principled. As I mentioned in my last blog, I am currently reading _The Score Takes Care of Itself_ by Bill Walsh. Bill’s book is practically a collection of principles. I am reading it partly because it is one of the top two books I have heard recommended by Keith Rabois who I am scheduled to have on the podcast tomorrow. Keith talks about first principles all of the time and clearly has used them to his advantage as a prolific operator and investor. Even as I am writing this piece now, I am doing so in large part because of a principle I learned from Naval Ravikant, a wise person who like Bill and Keith is well known for his principles. Naval once tweeted, “Inspiration is perishable - act on it immediately.” In my head, before looking it up to quote Naval verbatim, I had turned this into, “Seize inspiration immediately.” Either works.\n\nAnyway, I was reading Bill’s book quite contently out in the South Carolinian shade of a tree on a chair by a dock on a river when his reference to “an insatiable hunger to capture inspiration and answers that all highly driven people share” sparked inspiration in me to write. My monkey brain said to keep reading and that I could write about it later but my logic recognized that if I did not write now I might never and that, even if I did, it would likely feel like work then whereas it would feel like play now. Any action on inspiration is enjoyable in a way which nothing on a to-do list can usually compare.\n\nFunny enough, the thing I was inspired to write about is something that I have not even gotten to yet. Perhaps subconsciously I have dangled it out in front of myself like a carrot, using the inspiration to write about this thing as an inspiration to write generally until I felt that well of inspiration running dry and decided finally it was time to broach the subject that inspired me to write in the first place. That subject is defined by the second word in the quote that I mentioned from Bill’s book – “insatiable”.\n\nThe word insatiable may be insignificant to most but it holds a great deal of meaning in my mind. As far as I can remember, it was the first word I really liked for my answer to the question of “What is one word you would use to describe yourself?” I may be mistaken but I believe the first time I was asked to consider that question was while applying to a few private high schools. If that is true, I believe it is also true that I responded with the word insatiable. I remember my mother encouraging me to find a better word because the word insatiable to her had some negative connotations. She was not wrong. I have argued from a logical standpoint that there is no such thing as good or bad. This is the same as suggesting that all things are good and bad. Even easier than that argument, however, is the argument that the attribute of insatiability is both good and bad. In case this is not obvious, I will go ahead and explain it.\n\nAs my title suggests, I believe insatiability is both a blessing and a curse. It is a double-edged sword which must be wielded carefully. It can make you or it can break you. I am not sure I could escape it so I choose to embrace it. The benefits of insatiability are plentiful. It is the root of all drive and sets the aim of ambition. \n\nAs an insatiable person, I am almost never satisfied. When rarely I am, it is a feeling that is all too fleeting. There is always something to be improved or something greater to do next. For the insatiable person, achievements are merely means to endlessly ambitious ends. The blessing is the relentless persistence powered by the lack of satisfaction. The curse is the persistent lack of satisfaction itself. This is why I say insatiability is a double-edged sword which must be wielded carefully.\n\nI am still young and figuring things out, opening the door of my mind to you as best I can as I do so, but I think it is important to remember that the sword is for using rather than to use you. To let the sword use me would be to let it drive me into the ground. It would likely lead to fighting and losing a battle versus depression. It would lead to living a lousy life but one of considerable accomplishment in some narrow area or two to which my insatiability by happenstance became applied, like banking for example. \n\nI went into banking after school because I viewed it as the best opportunity to begin a career in business, because it paid well, looked good, and offered the opportunity to learn a lot, among other reasons. In banking, as in any environment, many people share similar perspectives and aspirations and both become more difficult not to subconsciously conform to as you are continuously exposed to them day in and day out. I have no doubt that my insatiable nature could have led me to work insanely hard for years on end to become a Managing Director without ever realizing that my insatiable nature was driving me to advance further and further in a game that I never actually wanted to play. Some people like that game and that is fine for them but it became evident to me in just a couple of years that it was not the game I wanted to play even though I was fortunate enough to be granted a slot in the race. I am thankful that I was able not only to recognize that fact but to act on it and quit without the reason that most have to do so, because they have another job lined up. \n\nTo use the sword rather than to be used by it means to choose when to unsheathe it. In other words, it means to choose your battles wisely. It stands to reason that if you do well in the best battles, you will do well in the war, and though there may be no way to ultimately win for the person who is so insatiable it could be considered a sin, I do believe that satisfaction is a spectrum and that even the most insatiable person can find themselves on the good side of the line even if they can never get to the absolute end.\n\nThis is all nice for me to write and think about but there are some practical measures worth mentioning in addition to the somewhat philosophical ways of thinking about insatiability that I touched on above. If one is to use their insatiable nature to their own benefit, they must learn to protect from the downside of the double-edged sword beyond simply learning where best to apply the upside. It is naturally unpleasant to be insatiable. If given the choice to be satisfied or unsatisfied in a given moment, no sane person would choose the latter. Though insatiability can be helpful in the long-term, it is never desirable in the moment, and so one must choose gratitude which, if granted full focus of the mind, cannot be interrupted by insatiability, as hard as it may try. One must have the will power to overcome one’s own nature on occasion so as to balance the scales a bit and counter the compulsion to be dissatisfied. I aim to accomplish this mostly through my morning journal which gives me at least a few minutes of positive thinking and gratitude every weekday, and in maintaining a generally positive mindset. Meditation would probably help too.\n\nIn closing, it is worth mentioning that there is no easy solution for the person with the power and problem that is insatiability. There are some helpful frameworks as I have endeavored to write a bit about above, but there is no easy answer. As with most things, the answer lies somewhere in the balance and the scales are never still, especially for the person who is hardest to be satisfied."}]}

That is a trap.\n\nPeter Thiel co-founded Paypal in 1998 and has since become a famous venture capitalist. Scott Adams created the _Dilbert_ comic strip. Scott does not sound as rich as Peter. He is not. Still, his estimated net worth of $75 million, unlike his comics, is nothing to laugh at.\n\nPeter has been quoted many times saying, \"competition is for losers.\" I believe he is right.\n\nThink about the NFL for example. Every season, 32 teams compete for the ultimate goal of winning the Super Bowl. Every season, there are 31 losers and 1 winner. Usually it is the Patriots. Hopefully that is over now.\n\nThink about the players. [NCAA data ](http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/football-probability-competing-beyond-high-school)showed that in a given year 73,712 out of over 1 million high school football players went on to play in college. Just 254 of them are drafted into the NFL each year. In other words, the chances of a high school senior football player going pro is less than 1 in 1,000. Even if they defy the odds to get there, [the average NFL careers lasts 3.3 years and 78% of players go broke within 3 years of retirement](https://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/207780/current-and-former-nfl-players-in-the-drivers-seat-after-completing-mba-program). It is worth considering that the mountain might not be worth climbing if only 1 in 1,000 get there and 4 in 5 fall right back to the bottom once they do. Tom Brady may be a winner, but the NFL is a loser's game. Almost all of the most popular games are.\n\nPeter competed from a young age, got into Stanford, then Stanford Law, then became a lawyer at a prestigious law firm before deciding to quit seven months in. He realized he had been competing in a loser's game. In the competition to become a partner at the firm, many more would lose than win. He had already come much further than most by getting into the firm in the first place, but remember, the average NFL career lasts 3.3 years. Peter realized he was competing in a loser's game. More importantly, he realized this was not at all the game that he wanted to play. It was simply the competition he got drawn into by the external pressures which fed his burning desire to compete. Since then, Peter has found his extraordinary success by actively searching for opportunities where there was no competition. He founded PayPal as the first successful online payments company. He went on to invest in monopolies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb and many others. By striving to avoid competition, he has ironically become one of the great founders and investors of our time.\n\nScott, the cartoonist, also does not believe in the merits of competition. He recommends instead becoming very good (like in the top 25%) at two or more things and putting them together. He said, \"In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I'm hardly an artist. And I'm not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I'm funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes.\" This is how Scott made himself a success with Dilbert.\n\nIt is unnaturally difficult not to play the game that everyone around you is playing. It is difficult too not to compete in the ways that society tells you is good. But competition is for losers. Restaurants don't make money. Steve Jobs said, \"Think different.\" Apple does."}]}

I imagine a small percentage of them like running in the rain.

My first thought was no, of course not. I think that was because that would be anyone normal's normal answer, but I thought about it some more. I kind of did. I enjoyed it because I knew no one else was doing it and because I was, because I believe in the running schedule I am following right now, because my legs felt good because yesterday was a rest day, and because I enjoyed the[ podcast with Elon Musk](https://blog.ycombinator.com/elon-musk-on-how-to-build-the-future/) that I listened to during the run. As much as any other reason, I think I enjoyed it because I knew I would be glad that I did it.\n\nI have long thought about the difference between doing things I will enjoy in the moment versus doing things I will be glad I did later. Stated differently, I think about the difference between living life to enjoy every moment versus living life to be glad about what I have done with it all the way through. Ideally, the two are one in the same, but often times, they are not. I realized today that we can do typically unenjoyable things that we think we will be glad we did later, and that we can actually enjoy them _because_ we know we will be glad we did them later.\n\nThis may be easily intuitive to some. It may even make me sound as foolish as I must have looked running in the winter in the rain today. Regardless, I think it is meaningful. I believe it is good to do things that we are confident we will be glad we did later, and to enjoy those things, for that reason alone or otherwise."}]}

They have been said by many people many times before. It was one person saying them one time that made them stick with me. That person was Kobe Bryant.\n\nI[ ](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/27/kobe/)wrote about Kobe the day after his death earlier this year. In doing so, I shared four of his direct quotes. One of them has come to mind, word for word, over and over again ever since I shared it.\n\n_\"Do not negotiate with yourself.\"_\n\nThis seemingly ordinary piece of advice has had an extraordinary effect for me. After becoming aware of Kobe's words of wisdom, I became more aware of the moments in which I was negotiating with myself. I stopped negotiating with myself in those moments. Recently, I realized my brain has been trained to stop negotiating with myself in certain situations altogether. It is so much better this way.\n\nFor example, I knew I was due to run 17 miles last Sunday. I did not feel like running at all when I woke up. I was slightly dreading it the night before. Even once I got started, the first couple miles were tougher than typical. They were slower than standard. The old me would have battled myself for the rest of the run.\n\n_\"Don't you think 13 is good enough for today? That's still a great run. Legs don't feel good today. What if you just push the schedule back a week? You can do 6 today and 17 next Sunday. What's wrong with that? Well, you said you were going to do 17 today. But you don't want to push too hard if you don't feel great. You're going to hurt yourself. Forget that. Don't be a *****. 6 could work though. 13 would still be really hard. Just do 13. 13 is fine. But you did say 17...\"_\n\nThe mental battle would persist throughout the run. It would make the run harder and unpleasant. It would occupy my mind from being able to focus on the podcast I was listening to, or my other thoughts, or the nature around me, or nothing at all. At every mile mark, I would think about whether I had gone far enough to stop. All it takes is a split second to quit. Then you're done.\n\nDo not negotiate with yourself. Just do what you set out to do. Do not entertain any other options.\n\nI had some minor urges to negotiate Sunday's run with myself on Saturday night. I noticed at one point saying to someone, \"I am supposed to run 17 miles tomorrow\". The phrase \"supposed to\" was a clue which showed that I was considering negotiating with myself. If I was not, I would have simply said \"I am going to run 17 miles tomorrow\" instead. Still, I did not let the negotiation take place. I did not entertain the notion of doing anything other than what I had planned to do. Once I got started, the concept of not doing what I set out to do was gone entirely.\n\nCould a real injury along the way have changed that? Probably. When Kobe tore his achilles, did he finish the game? No. But he shot the free throws before leaving the court. Some may think that shows a strong body. That shows a strong mind. Unless you physically collapse, it is not your body that is deciding to stop. It is your mind. Do what you set out to do. Do not negotiate with yourself.\n\nI will close this post with a second quote from Kobe. It is the same quote that I used to close the [original post](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/27/kobe/) that I wrote about him.\n\n_“Have a good time. Enjoy life. Life is too short to get bogged down and be discouraged. You have to keep moving. You have to keep going. Put one foot in front of the other, smile, and just keep on rolling_.\""}]}

James' podcast _Below The Line_ aims to uncover the true stories of founders' journeys before they were successful, including honest recollections of all of the ups and downs along the way. Most successful people tend to only share the surface level highlights of their stories, and as such, that is all that most people get to hear. James' podcast is refreshingly real and I recommend it strongly to anyone who is interested in learning about the true journeys of entrepeneurs.\n\nIn the episode that I mentioned, Mike offered a useful framework for decision-making that I had never heard before. He said that most decisions are either 70/30 or 51/49 in terms of right/wrong.\n\nIf we feel we are dealing with a 70/30 decision, then we feel we know which decision is the right one. Unfortunately, we often hesitate to make the right decision even when we know it is the right decision. Worse than that, we often make the wrong decision even when we know it is the wrong one. This is an important point to recognize. We can all work as hard as we want to improve our decision-making abilities, but if we do not make the right decisions when we are confident they are right, it is all for naught. With 70/30 decisions, Mike says that people should just make the right decision and make it quickly. Time is a valuable resource and any time spent dwelling further on a 70/30 decision is a waste of time and a disservice to self.\n\n51/49 decisions comprise most of the rest of them. These are the decisions in which we do not feel confident either way. The trick here is to feel equally confident both ways. If it is a 51/49 decision, it will be very hard to argue that either way is right or wrong. Same as with 70/30 decisions, we should move forward quickly without dwelling on 51/49 decisions, not because we know the right decision, but precisely because we do not know it. I have written about the ambiguity between right and wrong and good and bad [here ](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/18/no-such-thing-as-good-or-bad/)and [here ](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/19/good-bad-right-wrong-and-the-meaninglessness-of-words/)in the past and it is a core principle that I rely on a lot.\n\nThe 70/30 vs. 51/49 framework for decision-making is intended to help us make more good decisions faster. Combined with a sound approach to analyzing those decisions in the first place, this should lead to a better path as directed by these good decisions.\n\nMaybe you can make a 70/30 decision right now."}]}

More and more, it seems like people are [going outside again](https://blogofjake.com/2020/04/23/going-outside-again/). I spent the majority of my days this weekend down at the pond, my favorite place to be outside. I read a lot about the climate while enjoying its present state.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call  _The Weekend Miscellaneous_.\n\nRecords runs - My typical weekend runs were not necessarily typical this weekend. The long run on Sunday was my longest ever, 15 miles, and not particularly painful. I rather enjoyed it for the most part. The short run on Saturday was set to be my typical three miler. I should note that up until several months ago, I considered 3 miles to be a long run as I usually ran just one or two. That was until my buddy Eric convinced me I should slow down, go further, and consider 3 to be a short run. That is the way I have looked at it ever since October when we started running together in Japan. (Thanks, Eric.) Perspective is everything. Anyway, my short run Saturday was briefly interrupted soon after the two-mile mark. I felt something hit the back of my throat and before I could process that it was a bug I had already reacted by swallowing it. My first thought was \"OK, good protein.\" My next thought was, \"Is this thing still in my throat?\". My third thought was, \"It's probably still alive.\" That was when I realized this was going to end with a puke. I held it down for a moment in order to avoid upchucking in front of a passing vehicle. Then I pulled over next to a bush on the side of the road and threw up in someone's front yard. Rather than inspect my own vomit to confirm the presence of the bug, I decided to assume it was in there, got back on the road, and finished out my last mile. It ended up being the fastest 3 miles I have ever run.\n\nBooks on the Climate Crisis - I read a new book called _[Facing the Climate Emergency](https://www.amazon.com/Facing-Climate-Emergency-Transform-Yourself/dp/0865719411)_ by Margaret Klein Salamon on Saturday. Sunday, during my run, I listened to the audio version of _[What We Know About Climate Change](https://www.amazon.com/What-About-Climate-Change-Press/dp/0262018438)_ by Kerry Emanuel. I felt that both books were well done, but with different objectives and for different audiences. Margaret's book was primarily a call to action. As a former psychologist, she urges her readers to face the truth of the climate crisis, welcome the fear and negative feelings that come with it, and choose to confront those feelings directly instead of pushing them away or escaping them. She closes the book by suggesting a multitude of ways by which people can and should join the climate emergency movement. In an evidently different approach, Kerry's book sought to provide a clear and straight forward summary of the facts. I found it to be tremendously informative. Secondarily, it can be useful as an outline for how to think about the climate crisis and how to calmly discuss it with anyone who denies the facts of the matter. As both an MIT professor of meteorology and a political conservative, Kerry seems to provide as close to an unbiased representation of the facts as I have found. As is suggested by the title, he writes about \"what we know\", but also, just as importantly, what we do not know. He writes about the degree to which many aspects of climate change fall somewhere in between those two extremes because the system is so complex that, while some direct impacts are known, the more indirect impacts are difficult if not impossible to predict. Kerry's book was better for me personally but I cannot say for sure whether I would have proceeded to read it had I not read Margaret's book first. Perhaps they both served their proper purpose. The contrast in approach between these two books reflects that which exists within the movement to counter climate change itself. There are efforts to recruit versus efforts to inform and it seems that both will be necessary in driving the appropriate level of attention and urgency to this matter of global significance. I plan to continue spending a good deal of time reading and writing about this issue which it seems will inevitably define the development of the future in our lifetimes and, if left unresolved, in the lifetimes of our children and theirs to follow.\n\nBrody's ashes - I am not sure whether I have mentioned my old dog on the blog before. His name was Brody. Brody was a Wheaten Terrier. He passed away last summer at the old age of 16. He would not so much as sit or stay unless a treat was involved, but I am biased to say that he was a good boy. We took his ashes and spread them outside in the field where he used to bark at our neighbor's horses. He once broke through the electric fence and got over to where the horses were to chase one of them around as he had been barking to do for years. I must have been in middle school at the time. When I heard a frenzy of yelling outside, I ran upstairs from the basement. I got outside just in time to see Brody hanging onto the running horses tail. He promptly received the full horsepower of a kick in the head. Brody was bleeding out of his mouth and we feared the kick might kill him but my parents brought him to the animal hospital and he turned out to be just fine. The place where Brody most loved to bark and rebel against calls for him to come back in the house seemed to be the most fitting place for his ashes. We spread them in the field and they flew away in the wind. It was nice. Everyone spread some with the bag and I took a pinch and threw it too and rubbed the dust between my fingers. I washed them off with water. Brody's ashes were free."}]}

Some one at some point figured out that if you break an activity or a game down into its various parts and work diligently on improving individual skills through fundamental techniques, you improve more effectively than you otherwise would by doggedly practicing the overall activity.\n\nWhen it comes to reading, there are two very effective tips that I learned from Tim Ferris.

I called it, _**The 100 Public Experiments Experiment**_. I added a description as follows:\n\n> _Description: This is exactly what it sounds like. I’m going to try 100 public experiments, as an experiment. I’m not going to define what a public experiment is or mandate any criteria, but expect some emergent characteristics may become clear as I do them. I won’t define an objective either. My hypothesis is simply that this is worthwhile_.\n\nI added bullets for the first dozen or two that came to mind -- an aggregation of ideas I'd had previously. Then, in the weeks that followed, I added a bullet to the list any time I had an idea that seemed like it belonged. The chapter, _Seeds_ , from Rick Rubin's new book, _[The Creative Act](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/0593652886) ,_ provides an excellent description of a similar process. I read that a few weeks after starting my list and could not believe how much it seemed like he was describing what I was doing. But that's not what this post is about, and his chapter is great, so if you want to learn more about this, just go and read that.\n\nWhat you should know is that my list is now 78 bullets long and I have intentionally kept from going through it until today. I have only been adding bullets to the bottom (and perhaps seeing my few most recent bullets by accident, since they're on the screen).\n\nNow, bear with me for a brief detour...\n\n10 days ago, I tweeted this:\n\nAs a result, several people DM'd me. I quickly booked 7 \"Life Advice\" calls for later this month.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd7a9a1-7e8e-489a-acfe-58b7bf6e1fd2_1021x221.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd7a9a1-7e8e-489a-acfe-58b7bf6e1fd2_1021x221.png)\n\nThat was the detour. Now, back to the list.\n\nToday, I decided to review my list of experiments from top to bottom for the first time since I started it. I started at the top but didn't get to the bottom. As a matter of fact, I didn't get past the first bullet. I had to go and write this blog post. Why? Because of what the first bullet said:\n\n>   * Life coach calls\n> \n> \n\n\nNow, I know this might be one of those \"had to be there\" or \"had to be me\" moments which is hard to appropriately appreciate since you're not me and you weren't there, but let me try to explain. For more than 2 months, I had intentionally resisted reading this list because I wanted to stay in collection mode before moving on with selection & execution. Little did I know that 10 days ago I started executing on the list, beginning with the very first bullet!\n\nThink about that. 77 bullets and an infinite number of unlisted experiments and the first one that I started on a whim happened to be the very first bullet on the list. I should say, I am not totally surprised that something like \"Life coach calls\" was on the list. Life coaching in general is something I have thought about for a while, just like many of the bullets on this list. But I certainly had no conscious memory of the fact that that was the first item. I was so serendipitously surprised to see it there that I felt compelled to write this. And by now I've realized that this is a bit of a difficult thing to communicate and that those who know what I'm talking about will get it but those who don't probably won't. That's okay. Maybe just trust me on this one and start writing things down.\n\nI am convinced that there exists a mysterious power in writing things down. I don't know exactly how it works or why it works but I do believe _that_ it works. I have experienced it myself, and I have read about it from others who experienced it themselves. Scott Adams wrote about one version of this which he calls _affirmations_ in his worth-reading book, _[How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591847745/ref=asc_df_1591847745/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312061076565&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9178013256402554725&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030945&hvtargid=pla-434105675270&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=62837065140&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=312061076565&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9178013256402554725&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030945&hvtargid=pla-434105675270)_. Napoleon Hill and OG Mandino suggest similar practices in their books, _[Think and Grow Rich](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Landmark-Bestseller/dp/1585424331/ref=asc_df_1585424331/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312009828129&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=535790581163389345&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030945&hvtargid=pla-406163951913&psc=1)_ and _[The Greatest Salesman in The World](https://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Salesman-World-Og-Mandino-ebook/dp/B004G8PIQ8?ref_=ast_author_mpb)_ , respectively. The second of those books I first heard about from Matthew McConaughey who I recall had some experience like this himself. I am having a hard time finding the reference from [his book](https://www.amazon.com/Greenlights-Matthew-McConaughey/dp/0593139135/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_1/144-7110053-6867059?pd_rd_w=FxKk5&content-id=amzn1.sym.26a5c67f-1a30-486b-bb90-b523ad38d5a0&pf_rd_p=26a5c67f-1a30-486b-bb90-b523ad38d5a0&pf_rd_r=8JX8KW94YYY19522NCTN&pd_rd_wg=yEZ6c&pd_rd_r=1838aee5-7a1f-453e-9351-931ba31d3824&pd_rd_i=0593139135&psc=1) but I think he once wrote down that he was going to be an Oscar-winning actor, before he had even started acting, and rediscovered that note many years after writing it, after he had won an Oscar (or something like that).\n\nI like writing things down. Obviously, I have written a lot here on this blog. Writing one page in a [morning journal](https://blogofjake.com/2020/10/27/the-morning-journal/) and making frequent use of the Notes app are two of my longest standing habits. I don't have a formula or a step-by-step for you to follow. I am simply suggesting that you write things down more. You may rediscover something you wrote many years after writing it and be as surprised as I was earlier today, which is why I am writing this down."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Minimum Viable Editing (MVE)\n\nWhen I first started my blog in December 2019, it marked the beginning of several months publishing pretty prolifically. Specifically, I published a blog post every weekday for more than 6 months straight. It’s hard to do that in general, but there was one main thing I did to make it a bit easier. Or rather, one main thing that I didn’t do — edit. I wrote a lot, but I didn’t edit much. Said another way, I was able to write a lot _because_ I didn’t edit much.\n\nEvery weekday, I would sit down to write, and I would edit a bit as I went, just as I am doing now. I might also give it a full read through once I was done, and make a few changes as I did. But I did not belabor the thing. The initial rationale was purely practical. First of all, I had committed indefinitely to a weekdaily publishing cadence, so there was no putting a piece away and revisiting it another day — no sleeping on it and reviewing it with a pair of fresh eyes in the morning. I didn’t have some big backlog of written pieces waiting to be published. For the most part, I wrote every weekday, and I published what I wrote that same day. The second reason I didn’t edit much was that I had roughly no subscribers, no followers, no audience of any kind. I was writing without expectations that anyone would read what I wrote anytime soon, so who cares? I had the desire to write, and again, that includes a fair bit of editing as one goes, but I did not have the desire to edit much after the fact. So that was that. It was write and publish. Just write and publish. One piece out. Onto the next.\n\nLater, when I started my podcast, I applied some of the same principles in regards to editing, and as a result I did not do much of it. For podcasting, I had even further support for this approach. First, Joe Rogan’s podcast is mostly unedited and he has the most popular podcast in the world, so why should I edit? Second, I personally prefer less edited podcasts over the ones that cut out every single pause and filler word and even full segments of the conversation. To me, that feels over-“optimized” and unnatural — plus, a well-timed pause can hold a lot of value in a conversation. Without hearing a conversation as it was, a lot of context can be lost, and a big part of the value of podcasts compared to shorter-form content like tweets or tiktoks is that it provides that context — so why edit it out? Last but not least, and perhaps most importantly, moreso than editing writing, I really dislike editing audio or video. Whereas editing writing feels skillful, editing audio or video, at least in the context of editing a podcast, for me feels like a completely commoditized skill, a robot task, and a waste of my time. \n\nI feared that, if I made editing a material part of my recurring podcasting process required for every episode, I would end up quitting podcasting all together sooner than later because a large part of the process felt dreadful for me. Why spend time on a recurring basis doing something I don’t enjoy when it is not even clear that it will improve the quality or potential popularity of the podcast (i.e. Joe Rogan), and it may actually make it worse for some people’s preferences (i.e. my own)? So I made the decision to do minimal viable editing — a cut at the beginning, a cut at the end, and only editing anything in the middle that stood out as something that obviously should be edited out, like pausing the conversation to fix a problem with our audio connection, or a dog barking and interrupting the conversation, things like that.\n\nIn both writing and podcasting, I believe editing is a counterforce against publishing. In other words, the more you edit, the less you’ll publish, and vice versa. You’re only going to spend so much time on either writing or podcasting as activities overall, and the higher percentage of that time you spend editing, the less time you’ll spend writing, or thinking of new ideas, or finding and sending invites to new podcast guests, or preparing for the conversations. Plus, it’s possible that, like podcasting, over-editing writing can be more harmful than helpful past a certain point, and so the same argument holds as to why one should not waste one’s time on it.\n\nWhile I have held strong on this principle in podcasting, I lost it a bit with writing. As I gained a small following, knowing that some people would be reading my writing stopped me from feeling as free to publish with minimal viable editing. Somewhere along the way, I lost the feeling that I had nothing to lose.\n\nSo this is my public commitment, not to publishing on a particular cadence again, but to publishing with less time dedicated to editing in general. That might seem easier in that it requires less time but it is hard in that you need to sum up the courage to post something you haven’t painstakingly scrubbed for anything that might be poorly written, make you seem stupid, or be otherwise bad. It helps to remind myself of something else I wrote: Nobody Cares.\n\nIn closing, I should say that this does not mean I am going to start posting garbage. In fact, I believe most of the best writing of my life was published during those initial 6 months of mostly posting with very little editing. When I know I’m not going to edit much after, I tend to be a bit more thoughtful as I am writing, in a way that is helpful to keeping things cleaner as I go, and I also edit as I go, but in a way that still feels like a part of the “writing” more than explicit editing. The primary thing I want to do less of is the after-editing. For this one, I’m just finishing doing a full read through. It took more time and I made more edits than I would have liked to, but just like anything, writing and publishing with minimal viable editing is a practice. It’s a muscle I haven’t exercised in a while, and I’ve built some “bad habits” of spending substantial time editing, and not feeling as free to press “publish”. I’m hoping to start changing that.\n\nI doubt you’ll notice a difference from all this — only that hopefully I’ll be publishing more writing more often. You might find a few more typos. Then you might tell me, and I might fix it. So be it. The fact is that I don’t love editing and I don’t love reading my own writing right after I write it, just as I don’t love listening to my own podcast episodes right after I record them. I enjoy writing and I enjoy preparing for and recording podcasts. That’s it. More generally, I just love creating things and putting them out into the world. I believe focusing on the parts of the creative process that I enjoy is the best way to ensure that I will keep creating and sharing for a long time, so that is what I plan to do."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# 10x Technologies\n\nI recently posted a [podcast episode with Balaji Srinivasan](https://podofjake.com/2020/12/23/32-balaji-srinivasan/). He talked about a number of thought-provoking concepts. One in particular which seems to have garnered attention from listeners is what Balaji referred to as the \"Larry Page Dictum\". The idea is that, in terms of technological improvements, 10x can sometimes be easier than 10%. Balaji describes how changing paradigms can open opportunities for 10x improvements whereas incremental 10% improvements often become increasingly difficult to achieve and have certain limits.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from a [2013 interview](https://www.wired.com/2013/01/ff-qa-larry-page/) in which Page describes why he encourages employees to go after paradigmatic 10x improvements instead of incremental 10% improvements.\n\n> **Wired:** Google is known for encouraging its employees to tackle ambitious challenges and make big bets. Why is that so important?\n> \n> **Larry Page:** I worry that something has gone seriously wrong with the way we run companies. If you read the media coverage of our company, or of the technology industry in general, it's always about the competition. The stories are written as if they are covering a sporting event. But it's hard to find actual examples of really amazing things that happened solely due to competition. How exciting is it to come to work if the best you can do is trounce some other company that does roughly the same thing? That's why most companies decay slowly over time. They tend to do approximately what they did before, with a few minor changes. It's natural for people to want to work on things that they know aren't going to fail. But incremental improvement is guaranteed to be obsolete over time. Especially in technology, where you know there's going to be non-incremental change. So a big part of my job is to get people focused on things that are not just incremental. Take Gmail. When we released that, we were a search company—it was a leap for us to put out an email product, let alone one that gave users 100 times as much storage as they could get anywhere else. That is not something that would have happened naturally if we had been focusing on incremental improvements.\n\nLarry Page is not the only billionaire technology entrepreneur who believes competition is overrated and 10x improvements are critical. In his book, _[Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296)_ , Peter Thiel famously stated \"[competition is for losers](https://blogofjake.com/2020/05/14/the-losers-game-of-competition/)\". He argues that all successful companies are monopolies and that the strongest characteristic of a monopoly is proprietary technology which is at least 10x better than the next best alternative. Thiel and Page also agree on the idea that companies are doomed to decay (in Page's words) and die (in Thiel's) the moment they stop inventing in favor of making incremental improvements on what has worked for them in the past.\n\nJeff Bezos' company sits right above Page's on the list of the [5 highest valued companies](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) in the world. Like Page and Thiel, he too emphasizes the importance of going after 10x technologies. Bezos has said that \"you cannot invent without experimenting\" and that experimental failure is \"the kind of failure you should be happy with.\" He wrote in last year's shareholder letter that \"if the size of your failures isn't growing, you're not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle.\" Below is an excerpt from a previous[ shareholder letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzVmPBUYS4gaVE9Cc2tualVLMjA/view) he wrote in 2015 describing his logic for making extremely ambitious bets.\n\n> **Jeff Bezos:**_Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent change of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten….The difference between baseball and business, however, is baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate you can score 1,000 runs._ This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.\n\nPage, Thiel, and Bezos all appreciate the need-to-have nature of 10x improvements for any company that seeks to sustain lasting success as one of the most valuable organizations in the world. They tolerate strikeouts and encourage swinging for the fences. Without Google +, Fire Phone, or Thiel's failed venture bets, you don't get Gmail, Kindle, and SpaceX. It is no coincidence that Google created the [home for moonshots](https://x.company/) and [Bezos](https://www.blueorigin.com/) and [Thiel](https://venturebeat.com/2008/08/06/private-rocket-company-spacex-gets-20m-from-the-founders-fund/) bet more literally on shooting for the moon. These insanely successful founders owe much of their successes to their independent thinking and contrarianism and yet they have all come to the same conclusion on at least one thing. 10% improvements are the recipes for failure while 10x technologies are the keys to success."}]}

If power was purely a product of physical strength, we would have a silverback in the White House, instead of a whitehair. I’m kidding… But seriously, if strength superseded everything, monkeys might be running the world making movies called _Planet of the Humans_. Obviously, that is not the case.\n\nIt is not the case because, despite our relatively weak bodies, we have extraordinarily strong minds. We are smarter than monkeys and lions and tigers and bears. Most of us are even smarter than dolphins, and dolphins are very smart. Our human intelligence has allowed us to solve problems, plan for the future, and develop increasingly more impressive tools and technologies, from fire and wheels to iPhones and spaceships. That is why we run this planet — not because we are stronger than some other animals, but because we are smarter than all other animals. Our minds are our special strength as a species.\n\nI believe it is generally beneficial to double and triple down on one’s strengths rather than trying to improve upon every weakness. In baseball, if you are one of the top 10 hitters in the world, but you are really bad at fielding, you should not spend 90% of your time working on your fielding and just 10% on your hitting. You should continue to work on your hitting to see how great you can get and either spend the minimum amount of time on your fielding that gets you to the point where you can at least get by, or just sign to play for a team where you can DH (the designated hitter (“DH”) only has to hit — they don’t have to play the field).\n\nThere is a lot of obsession with physical fitness optimization these days. People like Andrew Huberman and Bryan Johnson are treated like deities by their countless followers. Don’t get me wrong — I’ve learned and employed some useful tips from Huberman, and I’m a fan of his podcast, and I respect Johnson’s goal to live an unprecedentedly long and healthy life, even if I don’t love or agree with all of his rhetoric. Interviewing people working to slow and reverse aging has always been a big part of my podcast, ever since my very first episode with Aubrey de Grey, a pioneer in the space who wrote the book _Ending Aging_. I would love to live healthfully to age 120+. That said, I am not “all in” on these guys or their methods. It’s all a little much for me. I’m all for developing technologies, novel drugs, and therapies that promise the potential to help us live longer, healthier lives, but I am skeptical that the difference between operating at a B+ fitness level and an A+ fitness level will move the needle much in terms of how I feel on a daily basis or how long and healthy a life I live.\n\nIt’s not like its takes 85 units of time and effort to score an 85% on your fitness and only 14 more units to score a 99%. The difference between 85% and 99% requires more like 10x as much time and effort, including a whole host of sacrifices which I’m not very interested in making (i.e. never having another slice of pizza, being a general pain to hang out with, spending hours every day in the gym, and depriving oneself of many of the simple joys in life due to a zero tolerance policy on a lot of things that are more or less harmless in moderation). Not only don’t I want to make such an extreme effort, I actually don’t think it’s the smartest approach. Everything you do has an opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of spending so much time focused on your fitness may be not spending as much time with friends and family, or working, or doing things for fun. Another opportunity cost of spending so much time physically training is spending far less time mentally training — learning, reading, writing, communicating, working, building, etc..\n\nTo over-focus on physical fitness, to some degree, is to spend an exorbitant amount of time on something we are unexceptional at as a species. It is to work on our weakness rather than doubling and tripling down on our greatest strength. I am all for physical fitness to the extent that it makes me feel better on a daily basis and gives me a materially higher probability of living a longer and healthier life, no question, but I am not for piling as much time and effort as I possibly can into my physical fitness. I’d much rather use and continue to improve upon my greatest strength, my mind."}]}

Some of it I predicted in [my post](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/10/coronavirus-predictable-reactions-prudent-preparations/) the day prior. Frankly, I did not expect it all to happen so quickly. We live in a world where milliseconds mean millions in the markets and any piece of information can be made accessible to anyone with internet access by anyone with internet access anywhere in the world with the press of a button. Stated more simply, money and information can move instantaneously, but other things can take time. The coronavirus, while spreading rapidly relative to the flu or other infectious diseases, of course cannot move as fast as information can today. That is to say, the coronavirus cannot go from one person to millions of people in a single moment, like a CNN headline or a Trump tweet.\n\nManufacturing masks and testing patients takes time too. Building new hospitals takes longer. Discovering a vaccine for this novel coronavirus will take significantly longer than that. But the actions that were taken yesterday by companies, schools, and other organizations around the country seemed swift, strong, and responsible. Many of them were immediate, triggered by an email sent with the press of a button, changing the daily lives of thousands of employees or students in a single moment. One could argue that some could have acted earlier, but they also could have easily acted much later or not at all. Since we really do not know how exactly this all is going to play out, it will be impossible to have known when exactly, if ever, would have been the right time to act until the consequences of acting or not acting will have already been faced, and it will have been far too late, assuming it becomes evident at that point that some action should have been taken. That is why the fact that many organizations acted at all yesterday I think is applaudable, and it is those actions that give me reasons for optimism today.\n\nSadly, I know global infections and deaths will continue to get worse. I do not know how much worse, but I know that the actions of many decision-makers yesterday have helped to make it so that it will be less worse than it otherwise would have been. That does not suggest anything about the absolute damage, but only that the relative damage will be less, and it is difficult to argue that fact. Most of these organizations will lose dollars in exchange for saving lives. They may not save an employee's life, or a student's, or a player's, but they will almost certainly save people who are degrees of separation away from those people they have made less likely to acquire and spread the infection by disallowing them from congregating together as usual for the indefinite near-term.\n\nParadoxically, it is these same preventative actions which have made it much harder to realize those reasons for optimism today. The more responsible we are as people and the more cautious we behave, the more panic it brings via the unignorable realness of the actions themselves and the very news of those actions being taken. For many people, for example, the coronavirus was something they thought little about and treated very nonchalantly until their employer told them that their office would be closed for the next few weeks at least and that they would need to effectively figure out how to work from home until further notice. Many others might have thought this was no big deal until they saw their savings in investments go way down this week, day after day after day.\n\nAs people's daily lives are changed not just by this pandemic but by the measures taken to mitigate it, and by the news cycle and financial market effects that ripple off from them, we may find a counter to a natural inclination to panic with the optimism that all of these things we are doing will make a tragic outcome at least a little less tragic than it otherwise would have been.\n\nIn some ways, this is an early demonstration of the increasingly connected world and the potential that we have to make it a better one. Individuals today by means of social media, blogs, podcasts and alike have more power to spread knowledge, information, and influence than at any other time in the history of the world. That means we all have the power with our voices to help mitigate foreseeable tragedies like the one that the world is battling today, and with our minds to pay attention to those voices, to find the ones we trust, to be skeptical but reasonable, and to choose what we come to believe. As goes the famous quote, \"[With great power, comes great responsibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLj988xA08I).\"\n\n[China ](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/)and [South Korea](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/) (assuming the numbers of new cases reported are reasonably accurate) have shown that we as people can move faster than the coronavirus. We can beat it, but that does not mean we will. Actions like those taken yesterday will only help our chances, and the reality is that there is no black and white when it comes to winning and losing in this matter. Like in war, we will both win in eventually gaining the upper hand, but lose in the casualties and damage suffered in the heat of battle. It is our responsibility to do that which with reasonable cost and effort we can do to limit that number of casualties and to limit the amount of damage. The way I see it, people all over the country took steps in a right and responsible direction yesterday. Those are the reasons for optimism today."}]}

I actually acted in a couple of them back in our college days.\n\nHe recommended that I check out some of the early works from the Safdie Brothers, an eclectic directing duo from New York who, still only in their mid-30's, have become best known for their recently released Adam Sandler featured film, Uncut Gems (I still need to see it).\n\nI decided to watch [this documentary ](https://www.amazon.com/Lenny-Cooke/dp/B01GIZMWMY)they directed on high school basketball phenom Lenny Cooke who famously failed to ever play a game in the NBA after once being ranked a higher prospect than LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. For anyone who likes basketball or enjoys sports-related documentaries, it is an unfortunate and somewhat cautionary tale that is well done and worth a watch.\n\nSpeaking of Carmelo Anthony, I am very glad to see my all-time favorite basketball player continuing to thrive after his unexpected resurgence with the Blazers. Melo is one of the best offensive players I have seen in my lifetime, he can play solid D when he wants to, and I have always opposed the argument that he could never be a part of a winning team. He led Syracuse to an NCAA Title as a freshman in 2003. A winner is a winner in my book.\n\nLastly, as a Knicks fan, I have to say that while RJ Barrett looks reasonably promising in his first year, I always wanted Ja Morant in this most recent draft. I know the Knicks did not have much of a choice as he was drafted by the Grizzlies with the pick before theirs, but I would have certainly considered making a trade to swap picks. The kid is absolutely nasty and [these highlights](https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/28486375) from his last game, an impressive win over the Rockets, are as impressive a set of three plays by a point guard that I have seen in one half of basketball in recent memory."}]}

Unlike last weekend, for whatever reason, our local Bedminster Pizza was not doing delivery. We called in the order and paid by card over the phone before driving over, parking with a couple of spots in between ours and the car next to us, and opening the door to the backseat. I called inside and had them bring the boxes out, put them on the backseat, and close the door before we drove away. It was a clean transaction in the literal sense, and my first time leaving the house other than on foot in more than a couple of weeks. In these distanced times, the eventful picking up of a pizza was my Saturday night adventure.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call  _The Weekend Miscellaneous_.\n\n_[Bill Withers](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ThoqLcyIYvZn7iWbj8fsj?si=PRzJRkR-R-qBUI3Yvrhj1w)_ \\- Often we come to appreciate people most only after they are gone. This is an unfortunate aspect of the human condition. \"Memento mori\" is a wise saying that I have come to appreciate. The Latin phrase translates to say, “Remember you must die”. It helps me make the most of life. Additionally, remembering that everyone will die helps me to appreciate the people in my life. Eerily, in the [last music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsKT0s5J8ko) before his tragically young death, Mac Miller etched out the words “memento mori” inside the top of a coffin that he was stuck in while smoking a cigarette. I have written about how [big a fan I have always been of his music](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/17/circles/), but never did I appreciate it more until after he was gone. When Kobe died earlier this year, [I began to appreciate him too more than ever](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/27/kobe/) as I joined the world in remembering the highlights of his life and watching the highlights of his games. This weekend, Bill Withers passed away, and it was not premature like Mac or Kobe, and, honestly, I could not have even told you with any confidence whether he was dead or alive before I heard this news that he passed, but his passing has caused me to go back and listen to more of his music nonetheless. He has more than a handful of popular songs including Lovely Day, Just The Two of Us, Use Me, Leon on Me, Ain’t No Sunshine, and Grandma’s Hands which I would say I like best in that order. Lesser known songs that I have played over and over again in the past include Can We Pretend and Sweet Wanoni, but I recognize that I have a whole lot more digging to do. When it comes to appreciation, I believe strongly in the concept of better late than never. I hope to create things throughout my life that allow people to appreciate me more than ever after I am gone too.\n\n_[The Way Back](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8544498/)_ – Ben Affleck plays a construction worker in what seems like it could be the 30 years older continuation of his character from _Good Will Hunting_ , and that actually would not be far from consistent timing given the 23 years that have passed since the release of what is one of my top few favorite movies of all time. In _The Way Back_ , Ben’s character turns out to have been a high school basketball superstar and when something happens to his former high school’s basketball coach, the religious school’s priest asks the drunk you later learn to sympathize with to return for the first time since he left to try and bring the team to the playoffs for the first time since he left as well. There may not be a better movie genre for me than the underdog coach with an underdog team, so naturally, I liked this movie a lot. Was it on par with _Remember the Titans, The Hoosiers,_ or _Coach Carter_? No, no, and probably not. Still, I enjoyed it a lot, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes that kind of movie.\n\n_[Unscrypted](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/unscrypted-podcast/id1482850426)_ – My latest podcast obsession is helping me continue to scratch the surface of all there is to know about Bitcoin and the world of crypto. The podcast is a collection of audio recordings of unscripted talks given by Andreas Antonopolous, the best teacher of this subject that I have found, [whose Introduction to Bitcoin speech I have recommended in the past.](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/05/introduction-to-bitcoin/) If you like learning through podcast listening and you are interested in Bitcoin, this could be a great podcast for you, and if you are not interested in Bitcoin but you would be interested in what could be the most revolutionary shift in the concept of money that anyone alive will have ever seen, then I would humbly assert that you should be.\n\n_[COVID-19K Run](https://www.gofundme.com/f/covid-19k)_ – Last Friday, [I wrote about a fundraiser ](https://blogofjake.com/2020/04/03/covid-19k-feeding-america-fundraiser/)that I organized in which people are walking or running 19 kilometers at their own pace and on their own time over hours, days, or weeks to help feed those in need facing hunger in America. All of the great work for the cause is done by an organization called [Feeding America](https://www.feedingamerica.org/). I felt somewhat silly having started a fundraiser with a $19,000 goal when the day after starting it I saw that [Leonardo DiCaprio and Laurene Powell Jobs had since started a fundraiser](https://www.gofundme.com/f/AmericasFoodFund) with half of the proceeds also going to Feeding America and a much larger goal of $15,000,000. Still, I feel good about having created this means by which my limited network can contribute to this organization and I believe the objective of feeding hungry people who cannot afford to pay for basic needs will prove to be an essential in the coming months. I suppose Leo & Laurene can fall back on that same logic now that [Jeff Bezos has also since stepped in and donated $100,000,000 in one fell swoop](https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/jeff-bezos-support-food-banks). While these massive fundraises make mine represent nothing more than a rounding error, I am following through with what I set out to do. We continue to raise awareness and donations because no matter how small it all may seem in the scheme of things, I am very confident it will go on to have a positive impact of some magnitude. On Sunday afternoon, I ran my 19K like I said I would. It was the second longest run of my life and my 10 minute 20 second per mile pace was better than I expected I would do, so overall I felt very good afterwards, even though my body felt pretty bad. Like doing anything else in life, I found it was helpful to know the reason why I was running and to believe in that reason strongly. It was still hard as I am in much better shape mentally than I am physically, but it did make it easier all in all. If you did not see my previous post, you can find more information on the _COVID-19K Feeding America_ fundraiser at [www.gofundme.com/covid-19k](https://www.gofundme.com/f/covid-19k) .\n\nIt is a beautiful day today where I am home quarantined. I hope that is a sign for the week to come. We will make it through this wild time, one day at a time."}]}

I [read ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_\\(2019_film\\))that this past weekend (its 19th of release), the movie grossed about twice the amount of its previous best weekend (its 5th of release) due to a significant boost from the Oscars, which was what ultimately motivated me to see it, despite not having watched the Oscars at all, and so I suppose if you have not seen it yet, next weekend will be a popular one as well.\n\nI will endeavor to write the next sentence about the movie without giving anything away for those who have yet to see it, rendering unnecessary any disclaimer of a spoiler alert. My two favorite dialogues were the one about schizophrenia at the kitchen table and the one about planning after the rain.\n\nRelated to the latter of the two aforementioned dialogues, when it comes to planning, I think there is a logical truth in the idea that the only plan that never fails is no plan at all. I do value a lifestyle based on spontaneity. More than most, I enjoy playing things by ear and going with the flow, especially on weekends. Still, to consider planning to be useless and point to frequent failure as a rationale for never making any plan at all I think would be a disservice to self for most people. I believe that short-term plans can be very useful, mostly because they can be achieved with a higher probability of success than a long-term plan. I do not make many plans further than 3-6 months out, and if I have a plan or two that extends beyond a year or two, I generally understand that it is very much subject to, and in fact, more likely than not to change. It takes discipline not to plan because planning projects purpose and purpose brings comfort. In the long run, however, not planning too far ahead can actually make life more comfortable because one will not try to force the happenings of life down a predetermined path that may loss its sensibility over time. Whether one does not make plans at all or simply maintains a willingness to change them to me is not very important, but a plan without compromise is a plan destined to fail, most of the time, I have come to believe.\n\nTaking that all into consideration, for the foreseeable future I will plan to title my Monday blog posts \"The Weekend Miscellaneous\", and to write a bit about some miscellaneous things from the prior weekend including places to eat, movies to see, and anything else I feel like writing about really.\n\nValentine's Day Movies - Besides _Parasite_ , which I should explicitly say I thought was excellent and rightly deserving of all of its acclaim, I saw one other movie this weekend. _[Before Sunrise](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00C2C5DGK/ref=atv_dl_rdr)_ (1995) is the first in a romance trilogy that also includes _Before Sunset_ (2004), and _Before Midnight_ (2013). I am not familiar with any other trilogy in which the intervals between releases are 9 years and the leading actor and actress remain the same and so that aspect alone I find to be pretty intriguing. I have not seen the second or third of the series but the first was somewhere between good and great for me. A google [search](https://www.google.com/search?q=before+midngiht&oq=before+midngiht&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.2647j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of the third in the series brings up a top notch assortment of other movies in and around the love story genre including _Titanic_ , _The Notebook_ , _Her_ , and _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ , all of which are firmly in the category of great movies which I recommend more highly than _Before Sunrise_ , which I also recommend.\n\nValentine's Day App - [Bedford](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bedford/id1497297359) is a messaging app designed exclusively for a person and his or her significant other. It was created by Joshua Kushner (investor / entrepreneur / Jared's brother) as a Valentine's Day gift for his wife Karlie Kloss (fashion model / entrepreneur). I am not sure how much more time, money, or effort Joshua plans to invest in the app but I actually think it could have tremendous success and I recommend it to anyone who is intrigued by the concept. I wrote the company to give two small pieces of critical feedback that the automatic deletion of the messaging history should be optional and the ability to send gifs should be added.\n\n[F&F Pizzeria](https://www.franks.pizza/) \\- this is a pizza shop that opened last fall in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn. The two Franks for whom the pizzeria is named already had a very successful duo of establishments on the street and the addition of this pizza place between [Frankies 457 Spuntino](https://www.frankiesspuntino.com/457) and [Frank's Wine Bar](https://frankswinebar.com/) makes it a trio. [Black Gold Records](https://blackgoldbrooklyn.com/) sits between the pizzeria and the wine bar and I imagine the owner feels like he has the Community Chest between the three green avenues on the [Monopoly board](https://www.google.com/search?q=monopoly+board&sxsrf=ACYBGNSXcToS11GZJt97LXtcazGMkx5u7Q:1581954564471&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=NHsvGgjpIZszEM%253A%252C6yXRDXKz0gibkM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kSrHtJraIpdBQJXMJUnT238djBoGQ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj1zfb-99jnAhXLhXIEHaAjDk8Q9QEwAHoECAkQMA#imgrc=E_g6BtxBvMhIdM). I found F&F on my twitter feed thanks to this[ tweet](https://twitter.com/fredwilson/status/1228369944242311168) from Fred Wilson, the Union Square Ventures co-founder whose blog served as the initial inspiration for me to create mine. The garage looking space with quiet outdoor seating in the back serves very high quality New York slices, with or without cheese, as well as Sicilian squares, though they were out of those when we were there on Sunday. While I love all pizza, I generally prefer Neopolitan to New York style and it is tough for me to compare a pizza in one style versus the other. That said, in the New York category, F&F ranks up there with the best of them.\n\n[Di Palo's](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/t-magazine/di-palos-nyc-store.html) \\- on Saturday, we picked up a few things from my favorite Italian meat & cheese shop in the city. Di Palo's also carries stellar selections of pastas and sauces, frozen raviolis, crackers and cookies and other items for the cabinet as well. It is on the corner of Grand & Mott just off the main Mulberry strip of Little Italy, and it is a phenomenal place to go and pick up at least a quarter pound of prosciutto and some cheese."}]}

I first discovered the title earlier this year when I stumbled upon [its soundtrack on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXaia9KkgeyFc?si=pEyMZe8HSmWrThSyUPiKdw). I limited myself from listening beyond a few songs before watching. Now that I have seen it, I can confidently say it is one of my 5 or 10 favorite soundtracks I have heard in a movie, no exaggeration. Convinced by the music alone, I was looking forward to watching the movie once it became available for streaming. By the time it did, I had forgotten about it. I finally got to watching it last night. I highly recommend it. Had the film released this month instead of last November, I would not have been surprised to see it nominated for movie of the year. I do not mean to overhype it. In my opinion, a movie of the year level is far too high an expectation to set ahead of any viewing. That said, I have often seen only decent movies elevated to award status for their timeliness alone. If any of those movies qualified for such a premium, this fine film certainly does too. It raises a number of questions about what should and should not have happened in the story. I will share my brief perspective only partially on the latter.\n\nIn the beginning scene, the girl should not have made certain comments. The cop should not have pulled out his gun. The cop should not have shot the girl - it never should have gotten to that point. The cop should not have been shot - it never should have gotten near that point. Including the rest of the movie, anyone who was killed should not have been killed. I will not comment beyond that or beyond the confines of the movie in regards to racism. I do expect to share something at some point and it is probably not going to be a perspective you have read before. For now, I will simply end by stating that this movie deserves much more attention than it has received thus far. It is very well done, directly on point, and unquestionably worth the watch. I rate it an 8.1 out of 10."}]}

The average view on YouTube is much longer than the average view on TikTok, but they are both called “views”.\n\nThis is advantageous to TikTok (and shorter form platforms in general) because shorter content makes for larger numbers of views. People like large numbers.\n\nIn reality, a YouTube video with 10K views could attract twice as much attention (in terms of time) as a TikTok with 1M views if the average watch time on the YouTube video is 10 minutes and the average watch time on the TikTok is 3 seconds.\n\nThat’s 100K minutes on YouTube vs. 50K minutes on TikTok even though the headline “views” count on TikTok is 100x that of YouTube.\n\nThat’s what I mean by deceiving. The time variable is invisible.\n\nBut we know it’s all about time & attention in the end. What matters is how many people paid attention and for how long. “Views” don’t tell you either. Twitter “impressions” are another story.\n\nPerhaps these platforms could standardize on alternative main metrics like “minutes” and “uniques”. YouTube should be open to something like this. TikTok would probably resist. But then we could actually compare attention across platforms.\n\nUntil then, it’s just deceiving."}]}

I jotted down a few notes along the way, and when I got back, I wrote a book. I called it,  _All Across America_.\n\nI dedicated the book to my family and friends, to [Kerouac and Cassady](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0893QYWX8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) for the inspiration, and “to America, the beautiful.” At the end of the dedication I wrote, “Finally, to the people of America – who have exploration in their DNA, pursuers of opportunity, change-chasers and risk-takers, critical doubters and faithful believers, leaders of the new world.”\n\nI remain confident in all aspects of my assessment of the American people, except for perhaps the last part, “leaders of the new world.” I still believe that many Americans will be crucial leaders of the new world, but I am not so sure that they will be as dominant a part of that leadership as I had once imagined. I am even less sure that they will be leading from within the confines of America at all.\n\nSee, I still believe Americans have “exploration in their DNA\". I still believe they are “pursuers of opportunity, change-chasers and risk-takers, critical doubters and faithful believers\". It is for these very reasons that I believe within the next couple of decades we may see a mass emigration from America, similar to the exodus we are currently seeing from [San Francisco](https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1331832907003015168?s=20), but on a larger scale.\n\nIn the last few years, staunch opposers of the Trump Administration’s immigration policies have been quick to point out that America is a country of immigrants. Regardless of where one stands on immigration policies, it is clear to see that this observation is correct. It is a fact that The United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country in the world. The US has 4% of the world’s population but about [20% of the world’s immigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States). Expanding beyond the immigrants themselves, these immigrants and their US-born children comprise approximately [28% of the US population](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states). If we expand the classification of relative newcomers to also include people whose grandparents immigrated to America, the figure seems to be roughly [between 40-50%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/4621/majority-americans-identify-themselves-third-generation-americans.aspx).\n\nMoreover, I would argue that even those whose ancestors came to America long before their grandparents were born may still carry a bit of extra inclination towards exploration in their blood. Since its inception, America has been viewed as “the land of opportunity.” Generations of the most ambitious risk-takers from around the globe have left everything they knew to pursue an opportunity they couldn’t find at home. They sought lives that could be better than any which many of their friends had ever imagined, and America was where they came to find it. These people helped build America into all that it has become, but it is important to recognize that they did not come here because it’s called America. They came here because of what America was, and in the eyes of some, what it still is. But it seems to me that America's monopoly as the de facto land of opportunity is one which may be losing its dominance in a world that is ever more globalized, digital, and mobile. If that is in fact the case, America's position may be up for grabs in the decades to come, a position which could be filled by an old country, or a new one, or a few ones, or many. If better options than America do become available to a meaningful number of Americans who recognize them as such, we may quickly be reminded that every individual with immigration in their history has emigration in their blood.\n\nThe question will become whether there is something unique about American Patriotism, or whether recent immigrants or their children, grandchildren, or more distant relatives will do the same thing they or their ancestors did when they came to America in the first place. I wonder how many would gather their things and go somewhere they can imagine living a better life. I wonder how many would pursue a freer life in some new land of opportunity, in some newer newest attractor of the American spirit -- for that spirit is a part of the American people, not of the American land."}]}

This is the standard route that I have run along a few times every week since coming back to New Jersey at the beginning of social distancing in New York, the day after most of my friends companies went remote, which was the same day that I had plans to go to the Big East Tournament at Madison Square Garden. Fortunately, we decided not to go. Those of us that planned to go ended up getting together for drinks in the East Village and watching the games on TV. We decided not to go after news broke that March Madness would be played without fans but we did not yet know that the NBA season would be suspended later that night, that March Madness would be cancelled completely the next day, and that the games we were watching that night would be the last televised basketball games for a long while. I am grateful that we decided not to go to what was probably the largest gathering of people that night in what has now been recognized as the most infected city in the world and was probably well on its way to becoming so at that point. I had [written weeks prior](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/27/coronavirus/) about my level of concern for how the coronavirus could develop, and my concern itself had begun to develop weeks before I decided to write about it, but it was my idea to buy tickets for the games that night and ultimately my decision to pull the plug on the plan at the 11th hour. The lesson, if there is one, is to trust your gut and to act in accordance with your beliefs even if they are different than those of most of the people around you, even if they are different than what the mainstream media is saying, or what the the president is tweeting, or what the World Health Organization recommends. Of course, this is not a flawless rule that applies in all situations and it does not mean that you should disregard social distancing guidelines just because most people and organizations are now on board with them, but if your beliefs seem to be more responsible, conservative, and/or safer for you and others, and if you have a lot of conviction in them, then go with your gut. Fortunately, though I take full responsibility for initiating the issue in the first place, I was able to resolve it by going with my gut in the end.\n\nAnyway, back to that run that I mentioned, I usually stop one tenth of a mile before my driveway as that is when the mileage tracker on my phone says that I have hit 3 miles on the dot. Today, as I walked from that point to the driveway, I walked over two wires that I had never walked over before. The wires, laid a foot or two apart from and parallel to each other, were nailed into the road and connected at the end to a brick-sized plastic box with a logo on it that said \"[MetroCount](https://metrocount.com/)\". The box was attached to a white-painted wooden sign on the side of the road that says \"entering\" on the top line, and the name of my township below it. The sign was permanent and I had seen it thousands of times before but the box and the wires were new and today was the first time I had seen them. Between the newness and the placement of the box combined with the name that was on it, it was not difficult to surmise that this was a system installed yesterday to track the traffic in and out of my township, I assume, to measure adherence to social distancing orders which in New Jersey mandate working from home for non-essential businesses and restraining from non-essential travel. I could be wrong about any of that, but it does not so much matter as I am only bringing it up as a means by which to write about something more important than the number of cars going in and out of my small and rural New Jersey township each day.\n\nThe thing that I want to touch on today is how we are going to emerge from the quarantined state that we are in today as a country. The first thing that I think is important to note is that we may not emerge from it as a completely united country at all. Rather, we may emerge from it as a collection of potentially less united states. Governor Gavin Newsom has gotten into a somewhat frightening and potentially foreshadowing habit of [referring to California as a \"nation-state\"](https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1245158370824216576?s=20) recently. At least [15 states have now placed travel restrictions](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/us/states-travel-restrictions-list/index.html) on Americans coming in from other states and it seems probable that most of the rest them will follow suit. There is even one North Carolinian county that is ironically called \"Dare County\" which is not letting anyone in without a permanent residency entry permit, so things could go further in that direction too. Different states and counties will come up with different approaches and solutions because they are comprised of different demographics and governed by individuals and groups with different perspectives on how best to mitigate this crisis and eventually emerge from it. There will be overlap, of course, and hopefully some degree of national leadership but as long as it is every state for themselves it seems more likely that states will social distance themselves right away from each other and away from the whole. If secession was not already a realistic possibility for a large and left-heavy state like California in a scenario in which Trump is re-elected, it sure seems to me to be one now.\n\nThere is another aspect related to the nature of our emergence from this crisis which is arguably more impactful than a situation in which states could go separate ways in their attempts to save their own people's lives and livelihoods. That aspect involves how we handle things from a freedom and privacy perspective using technologies that exist today and which will be developed tomorrow. The MetroCount system that I ran across today seems relatively harmless. As best I could tell from the company's website, the device is counting aggregate vehicles anonymously in terms of traffic into and out of the county via this individual road. That seems harmless, but what if there was also a camera that captured license plates, a system for connecting that license plate to an individual, and a $1,000 dollar fine for anyone who crosses the wires in quarantined townships? That seems like something a lot of people might not like, and I do not believe it is much of a stretch at all. That technology and those systems already exist. That scenario may be controversial but not compared to another scenario in which the wires would be installed at the ends of everyone's driveways, instead of on the roads, and people would be charged a large fine just for leaving their homes. It is not impossible to imagine a situation in which people could be fined simply for googling \"what are the best ways to circumvent driveway wires\". This is no doubt a further out scenario, but compared to the premise of the movie _Minority Report_ in which murderers are arrested and convicted before committing the crime, the concept of being fined based on your Google history seems relatively civil. The key word there is \"relatively\".\n\nWhile it will be important to open the economy back up as soon as is reasonably and responsibly possible, the ways in which we do that in terms of the infrastructure that will need to be built and installed and the policies that will need to be agreed upon and enforced will be very important. [As I have written previously](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/17/dmvs-and-defaults-that-quietly-drive-decisions/), once the defaults are set, human tendencies do not naturally go against them or overturn them, especially when they are very complex. I doubt we will see American law enforcement welding shut doors of apartments to force quarantines, [as was reported to have been done in Wuhan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsoVuKy2_PA), but other non-physical methods of mitigating the virus could be just as, if not more, consequential. Will we have mandatory location tracking on our phones soon and forever? Could we do something similar but make it voluntary even though non-participation probably means more deaths? Could we make it mandatory but temporary and anonymous so that people can be alerted when someone they have been in close proximity to has tested positive, without necessarily needing to know who that person was, and without any central authority needing to know who any of the people are? These are questions that I have not thought about long enough or done nearly enough work on to form an opinion on or propose an optimal solution for. Still, I can appreciate the vast magnitudes of the impacts that these decisions will have on our communities, states, countries, and the world. I hope that leading decision-makers around the world are conscious of how powerful the defaults they set today will remain in perpetuity. I hope that they make the best decisions that they possibly can and that they do so [quickly but do not hurry](https://www.thewoodeneffect.com/be-quick-but-dont-hurry/). I am an optimist by nature and by practice and while I am preparing for the worst, I am hoping for the best.\n\nToday, in my township, it started with a MetroCount box. Soon, but not too soon, we will see how it ends."}]}

Often, I have had more than one. None of them have been particularly bad in the scheme of things, but some of them, like the amount I drank in college, are more obviously damaging if continued over the long haul than others, like the amount of video games I played when I was younger. I used to think that I needed at least one vice of some sort no matter what, but when my friend texted me earlier this week and asked if I had any vices at home, I realized that I did not.\n\nTo understand what that means for me in particular, it is useful to remember that I count relatively innocent activities like excessive [coffee ](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/03/painkillers-coffee-and-the-concept-of-withdrawal-reversal/)drinking and [iPhone ](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/05/consider-the-colorless-iphone/)usage to be vices too. I am not suggesting that you give up all of your habits, especially those as innocent as these, whether you consider them to be vices or not. There are many worse things to do than drinking coffee every morning and if that is something that you genuinely love, by all means, continue on.\n\nI write this not to convince anyone of any particular habits that they should break, but to give confidence to those who have ones that they know they want to break, but have not. I want to tell them definitively that it is possible to be viceless. I never thought I could be, until I realized I was."}]}

Those days are started late and ended early, respectively. Every other day is the same, 24 hours.\n\nMost of what happens within our days are the results of choices, concious or otherwise. I may choose to sleep 8 hours while someone else chooses only to sleep 5. I am sure you have often heard people respond to something that they say they want to do with “I don’t have time”. \"I know I should work out but I don’t have time ... I wish I spent more time with my kids but I don’t have time ... I love to read but I just don’t have time anymore.\" These people are either lying to you, or more likely, they are lying to themselves.\n\nMost of us feel we do not have time for things but in reality we do not have the relative desire for them. We may want them, but we do not want them as much as the other things we are doing with our time. If we did, we would do them instead. Importantly, I am not referring to a spoken want but an actual one. I can say I want six pack abs but if I am not willing to put in the physical work to get there I don’t really want that more than the other things I spend my time doing during my days.\n\nMost of the time, most people don’t truly want hardly anything as much as they want to check Instagram or Twitter or email. Of course, these are not the things they want directly but a means towards getting them. A dopamine hit from an Instagram like, a bite size piece of information or entertainment from a Tweet, or a sense of purpose through a feeling that one is needed, good at their job, and therefore good at something because they are known to respond to their emails in less than 10 minutes no matter the hour or the day. I know these things from experience.\n\nThe fact is that when one truly wants something and wants it more than everything else competing for the time in their day, one will absolutely make the time for that thing. Time does not come out of thin air. It comes from the other things we occupy ourselves doing. Everything is a trade-off. We operate based on a descending list of the things we care about whether we know them are not.\n\nTo understand what a real want feels like, it is helpful to think about and experience the fundamentals. Years ago, I watched [an awesome motivational speech by a guy named Eric Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcJHC9J7l4) where he tells his students they will be successful when they want it as badly as a person who is drowning wants to breathe (if you want to watch the first 3 minutes you will get the gist). Occasionally, I run several miles without a water bottle and I am reminded in the last couple of miles what it feels like to be truly thirsty, to want nothing but water. When you are sick, you usually want nothing but to feel better. When you are starving, all you want to do is eat. You will make time for what you want most. We can only do so much at a time and more distractions than ever are competing for our attention. This is why so many people feel there is not enough time in the day.\n\nNext time you think about something you want to do or know you should do but “don’t have time” for, think again. You have the time, you just don’t care enough. In many cases, you will be content with that realization. In others, you will want to change it. Fortunately, you can. It is not about time. It is about you."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Sensible Ignorance of Optics\n\nYesterday, someone told me a story. They were walking at their local park when they took note of a new, spider-webby-looking play thing at the jungle gym. It looked like fun. They wanted to go try it but worried what people might think of an adult on the playground. After some internal deliberation, they decided to do it anyway. It was a blast.\n\nThis morning, I was walking on the beach, near where the water meets the sand. I crossed a woman walking in the opposite direction. I was walking south and she was walking north so the sun was rising to my left and her right. I noticed from afar that she was wearing a hat that was pointed directly sideways, like a schoolboy in the 2000’s pretending to be a rapper. I hadn’t seen that style in a while, and never on a grown woman. At first, it struck me as odd. Then I realized it was blocking her face perfectly from the sun. It was not weird. It was smart. It was even cool because she didn’t care if it looked weird. I respected it. \n\nBoth of these stories share a similar thread. The person in them prioritizes what they want to do over how it may look to others. They are choosing to have a sensible ignorance of optics — the first one to have some fun, the second one to block the sun. \n\nIt would be extreme to suggest that optics don’t matter at all. The homeless person shooting up heroin on the sidewalk of a San Franciscan street is also doing what they want and ignoring the optics, but that can be really disturbing to the people around them. In addition to being generally unsmart, that’s just not sensible. \n\nThere are times when optics matter, when they should be prioritized over what you otherwise might want to do. You don’t show up to a wedding in sweatpants because you want to be comfortable. But sometimes it is best to have a sensible ignorance of optics. \n\nAfter the first person I mentioned was done having fun on the jungle gym, they looked back to see that the father of the only kids there was now playing on the spider web himself. Believe it or not, the very next person I crossed on the beach was a man with his hat pointed sideways just like the woman. I doubt it was a coincidence. Ignoring norms in a way that’s worthwhile can inspire others to do the same. That’s how we break the bad ones and make the new ones.\n\nSo, next time you want to do something but you’re worried about the optics, don’t disregard that worry as unfounded — it’s useful — but ask yourself if it would be sensible to ignore them in this case. It will probably just result in some small story like the two I’ve told above. But you might just start a revolution."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# \"We should\" vs. \"I will\"\n\nThere is a usually false dichotomy that people like to use which starts with the phrase, “There are two kinds of people.” While mostly imperfect, it does serve to make the point. Disclaimer given, I am going to use it as follows.\n\nThere are two kinds of people. Those who say “we should” and those who say “I will”. \n\nI learned this from my experience pledging back in college. There are a lot of problems that arise during pledging and a lot of things that need to be figured out and taken care of as a group. In such an environment, one comes to appreciate the people who say “I will” much more than the people who say “we should”. \n\nEveryone has ideas. It is easy, immediate, and mostly inconsequential to offer them. A lot of times this person even gets some credit for contributing, in their own mind if not in everyone else’s. Anyone can suggest things “we should” do. They can do it all day without lifting a finger.\n\nIt is harder to say “I will”. In saying “I will”, one is committing to doing something. The onus is on them. They have given themselves the responsibility to take care of something and they have stated its upcoming completion as a fact. Less people are willing to do this. It requires the time and effort to do the work. It exposes one to become at fault if the thing does not get done. It does not do anything in particular for the person, but it does do something for the group. This is a real contribution.\n\nNot everyone is a “get s*** done” kind of guy or girl. For those who are, getting things done is just what they do. On the flip side, getting a “we should” kind of person to get a thing done can sometimes seem like an impossible task, almost certainly harder than the one at hand. While I learned this during pledging, it applies just as aptly in business, sports, or any other group setting. \n\nAs I noted in the beginning, things are always more complicated than the phrase, “there are two kinds of people.” Chances are, you have probably said both “we should” and “I will” many times in your life, if not in the last week. Regardless of where one stands on the spectrum, I have reminded myself and would encourage others to be more conscious about their usage of these two phrases.\n\nInstead of saying “we should”, say “I will”. Then do what you say you will do. When it is not something that impacts a group, replace “I should” with “I will”. In this case, you will not be helping any group but you will find that you are helping yourself.\n\nThe next step after turning oneself into the kind of person who says “I will” is to evolve into the kind of person who says “I did”. At that point, you are taking care of things proactively before they are even being discussed. This requires thinking ahead, figuring things out, and getting them done. These kinds of people don’t care about a consensus for how everyone thinks something should be done. They just know what needs to be done and get it done however they can and see fit. \n\nThe final step does not require saying anything at all. Actions speak louder than words. The best kind of person to have in any group is the one who gets things done without telling anyone either that they are going to do it or that they did. It’s just done. Everyone knows a person who gets things done. Let that person be you.\n\nStart now. Instead of saying that you should become this kind of person, say that you will."}]}

I would propose unsheltered homeless people on the west coast be brought to a gated homeless community in an isolated, centrally located, and economically sensible area. A situational diagnosis upon arrival determines where each person starts in the community. Everyone is provided basic needs like food, water, shelter, sanitation, and safety. There will be opportunities to progress within the community and beyond. Those whose problems are deemed cheapest to solve are addressed first to allow them to rejoin normal society as quickly as possible. We should not futilely spend on a tough situation what we could otherwise spend to get several simpler situations resolved. At the same time, we should not overspend to send people back to cities with the highest costs of living in the world.

He has always told me to work hard and have fun. Accordingly, I have spent a lot of time working hard and having fun. It has been a great way to live so far, and it is one of the many great things I have learned from my dad.\n\nI vaguely recalled writing about this saying in the past and searched my inbox to find a draft essay that I wrote as part of an application to [Stanford's Deferred Enrollment MBA Program](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/admission/application-process/deferred-enrollment) when I was a senior in college. The program is designed for college seniors who want to get a couple years of work experience before filling their reserved spot in a class of Stanford MBAs. I thought that sounded like a pretty good gig so I applied to both that and to [Harvard's version of the same thing](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/application-process/Pages/student-applicants.aspx). I got rejected by both, applied to Harvard's MBA Program again a couple of years later, and got rejected again. I will aim to freely share my failures and rejections on this blog as they become relevant because I believe they as much as anything else will be the reasons for my success in the end. In the wise words of Norman Peale, \"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.\"\n\nAnyway, today I would like to share with you the drafted essay about working hard and having fun that I once wrote and frankly cannot remember if I eventually submitted or scrapped. I think this must have been the first draft from an initial inspiration because parts of it were not at all proper sentences (I cleaned them up minimally to be readable) and the email says \"Sent from iPhone\". The question that prompted the essay was something along the lines of \"What matters most to you?\", and for whatever it is worth, I would have a different answer today, but the following is still very important to me.\n\nHere was my drafted response:\n\n_What matters to me most is to work hard and have fun. I would assume that most people have a tough time remembering when what matters most to them started mattering to them at all. For me, it started in Kindergarten when my dad first started driving me to school in the morning on his way to work. When he dropped me off each morning, he would say, \"work hard, have fun\", and off I went to school._\n\n_I went to the same school K-8 and this became a daily school drop off tradition. Three years later, when I was starting the third grade, my brother joined the big boys ride to school for the first time. This time, it was his first day of Kindergarten. From then on, it was both of us to whom my dad would say, \"work hard, have fun.\" But the tradition did not last forever._\n\n_My family moved about 20 minutes south from the house that I was born in during my summer before the fifth grade. My dad had already stopped driving us some days because he was splitting time between his old office by our school and his new office by our new home. Now that we moved, my parents told me that we were going to start next year at the local public school, but I loved my school it was the only one I had ever known. I was miserable at my new school and I can almost still feel the uncomfortable feeling I felt those first few days there. I begged and begged my parents to let me go back to my old school and eventually they actually did. I am so lucky for their sacrifices and for generally putting up with me. In my middle school years, my mom would often tell me, \"you know, you're going to grow up to be a great lawyer one day\", which was a nice way of saying \"you are a stubborn little boy.\"_\n\n_I went back to what I knew and I worked hard, and I had fun, graduated, went to a new school for high school, worked hard, and had fun. College, felt like that other school, just not right, but this time I knew why. I wanted to work hard but my friends here were mostly only having fun. Partly my fault, I tend to befriend the most fun loving people in my environment. I could have easily found hardworking friends at this college, but maybe they wouldn't have had fun, or maybe they would have and I just had a bad start, I don't know, but I wanted out._\n\n_My gap year was really my first experience where working hard and having fun merged into the same thing. I was loving what I was doing most of the time, and most of the time I was working._\n\n_I got to my new college and returned to the old model for a year where the two (\"work\" and \"fun\") were pretty separate. I don't think high school or college is very conducive to working hard and having fun at the same time honestly. I was having fun with my friends and my new fraternity, and I was working hard in school._\n\n_My junior year was different. I decided at the beginning of the year I wanted to work hard one semester and have fun the next. I worked insanely hard recruiting for an investment banking internship during the fall and was fortunate to get an internship with the group I will now be joining full-time after graduation, and with my semester of hard work behind me and a summer of hard work ahead of me, I went and had fun. I studied abroad and traveled all around Europe and it was the most fun four months imaginable. It was unimaginable really. It wasn't just fun. It was truly amazing. My walk to school, St. Patty's in Dublin, Spring Oktoberfest in Munich, the baths in Budapest, beaches in Barcelona, biking in Amsterdam. A wine tasting in Tuscany. I don't expect to live that way ever again, and I'm fine with that, I'm just so grateful I got to do it once._\n\n_I worked hard that summer. I was the only one in the whole office who was in the office for at least a couple of hours everyday from the first to the last of the internship, including July 4th. I had my fun in the months prior, and this summer was for working hard to get a return offer, so I worked hard and got a return offer. On my mousepad, I wrote in black sharpie a quote from Muhammad Ali, \"Don't count the days. Make the days count.\"_\n\n_I had fun this Fall, and worked hard, mostly separately, the inevitable balance of college as I said, and I continue to do the same, but working a little harder, having a little more fun, and doing it by doing more things that combine the two, and wasting less time, which to me includes oversleeping._\n\n_Now that I'm graduating, I feel it in my gut that it is time to really work hard. I feel it is time for me to begin serving the world. I am tired of my parents and others serving me. I started serving this semester choosing to do my full time internship for my major with Boys & Girls Club. And I'm going to continue to serve, but in the ways that make me feel like my gap year. When I was having fun working hard. That's what I believe I will find at my first post-graduate job, despite the investment banking horror stories, I did it, and I don't have to have fears of stories, I have my own experience to reflect on as an intern being right with the full time analysts, and it seemed like a lifestyle I could enjoy. I will work hard and learn so much about finance and technology, the two things that, industry-wise, matter most to me, because I believe that money runs the world and technology changes it._\n\n_I want to come to Stanford for my MBA to meet like-minded people who can have fun working hard like me, and who have aspirations as high as the sky and are inspired, and brilliant, and crazy, and different._"}]}

The last time I read it was during my gap year in 2013/2014 when I was working on starting a company of my own. It was one of the first books I read cover to cover and it was immeasureably impactful on my perspective at the time. In many ways, it continues to inform how I think about life today. This book is not nearly as well-known as the official biography by Walter Isaacson, which I read as well, but I enjoyed this book more and found it to be more valuable to me personally. The organization and structure of the book is based upon [Steve Job's Stanford Commencement Speech, which I have written about previously.](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/13/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech-2005/)\n\nI often recall quotes from that speech such as \"you cannot connect the dots looking forward\", \"you have to trust in something; your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well worn path\", and \"remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.”\n\nBelow is a list of quotes from the book that I underlined in my recent reading. Perhaps one of them you will find to be worthy of an underline as well.\n\n8 - \"Well, my greatest reward I think is... I've been able to build this wonderful organization...

First people xeroxed documents and then they fedexed them and for most of my lifetime I have googled anything I wanted to know. In the last few years, many people have ubered everywhere, and that company should arguably get [bonus points for having a viral rap song named after its verb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcyFJLrBVhA).\n\nToday, while I still facetime friends & family for the most part, Zoom has emerged during this new and still somewhat foreign social distancing era as the overwhelmingly popular video communications company. Last month much moreso than ever before, we zoomed.\n\nHaving a verb or even a song named after your company, however, is no guarantee of success. Just ask Jeeves. I do not know that we will be ubering much of anywhere in 10 years either, but that is a theory to be explained on another day.\n\nToday, I am focused on the Zoom boom. In less than two months from January 27th to March 23rd, Zoom's share price more than doubled, increasing 127% from $70 to $159 while the S&P 500 dropped 31% from $3,243 to $2,237. Since then, as of today, the S&P is up 13% (for no good reason in particular) and Zoom is down 24% mostly comprised of a 6% drop yesterday and an 11% drop today. These drops came alongside stories in the news of privacy breaches and security hacks, Elon Musk's banning of Zoom use at SpaceX due to related concerns, and the introduction of a new verb that even the [FBI used in a memo ](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston/news/press-releases/fbi-warns-of-teleconferencing-and-online-classroom-hijacking-during-covid-19-pandemic)warning about the possibility of videoteleconference hijacking. A near but less comical cousin of the playful term photobombing, the people are calling it \"zoombombing\".\n\nToday, Zoom's Founder & CEO, Eric Yuan, addressed these concerns quickly, transparently, and seemingly carefully in a public [message to zoom users](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/a-message-to-our-users/). In the message, he mentioned that in March there were 20 times as many of them active on Zoom on a given day in comparison with just 3 months prior on their highest activity day in the month of December. From 10 million in December, they grew to 200 million in March ([about the same as Snapchat and even more than Twitter](https://twitter.com/tanayj/status/1245754330507952133)), and while they may experience some churn (a briefer word for customer loss) as a result of these privacy and security concerns, that churn will surely be opposed by some magnitude of continued influx in users due to Zoom's significant share of the video conferencing market to which the world is shifting, which includes products from big tech companies like Microsoft's Skype, Google Hangouts, and Cisco' WebEx, as well as a number of others like BlueJeans and GoToMeeting by LogMeIn. It is difficult to know how Zoom will ultimately be affected by this privacy & security issue. There is no way to know whether it will prove to be temporary and low impact or whether it will be such a blow to the trusting relationship between userbase and company that the company will never be the same. Zoom may be doomed, but this may also just be a small hiccup in the very early stages of a much longer boom. We have seen [companies in the past](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/your-money/IHT-tylenol-made-a-hero-of-johnson-johnson-the-recall-that-started.html?auth=login-google) take publicity nightmares and apparent trust-losing events and turn them right on their heads to become trust-building events and publicity darlings. In the long run, aside from it's great start, I do not yet have much confidence in Zoom's defensibility against their several big-time competitors and the number of others which will surely arise. For this reason, and also because of the general instability of the global economy which has kept me mostly on the investing sidelines besides [Bitcoin ](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/26/why-buy-a-share-of-amazon-today/)and other cryptocurrencies as well as a [single share of Amazon](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/26/why-buy-a-share-of-amazon-today/), I am not going to pull the trigger on buying shares of Zoom tomorrow morning, but I am counterintuitively warming up to the idea as a result of this whole zoombombing fiasco, because every obstacle presents an opportunity to show what one is truly made of. Zoom may lose the trust of its users, no doubt, but it also may respond in a way that earns their trust for the long haul, and I believe that its Founder & CEO took a step in the right direction towards doing that today.\n\nMore attractively, his letter addressing the issues revealed that the company has 20x'd its best daily active user count from last year and yet anyone with internet access can see that it is only trading 20% higher than the highest point at which it traded last year. I am practically writing myself into buying some shares but I am trying to remain patient as the gradual nature of this pandemic unfolds except for when I am all but certain in my conviction behind an investment. Generally, I would rather miss the bottom of this market than take the chance of locking up much of my money in it long before it gets there, even if that means missing out on a big chunk of the Zoom boom. Still, I am tempted."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Who Won Iowa?\n\nThe news in politics this week has centered around three major events -- the Iowa Caucus, the State of the Union Address, and Trump's impending acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial. I am going to focus on the first event because the second is relatively inconsequential from my perspective and the third simply marks the end of a process that most people have known would be inconsequential from the onset (at least in terms of its main objective to remove Trump from The White House).\n\nWe still do not have the final results from the Iowa Caucus, nor do we have a declared winner, but it seems to be between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders for the #1 spot, followed by Elizabeth Warren at #3 and Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar surprisingly close at #4 and #5 respectively with 71% of precincts reported. Typically, the complete results are announced the night of the caucus, which took place on Monday. That said, it has now been almost 48 hours and we still do not have the results because of a broken app that was intended to assist precinct leaders with reporting combined with the ineffectiveness of the phone lines that were supposed to serve as a backup for the app. The whole situation is a bit of a nightmare, especially in a national environment where people are increasingly mistrusting of institutions and authorities, skeptical of both the effectiveness and security of our democratic process, and hypersensitive to the truth or lack thereof behind much of the information that the public receives. Nonetheless, while we do not have a declared winner, we do have enough information to determine a handful of overall winners from this losing situation. Below are brief descriptions for the most notable five of them, in no particular order.\n\n**Mike Bloomberg** took a risk by declaring his run for president after the date by which he would have needed to announce to be on the ballot for the initial caucuses and primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. He then doubled down by imploring the other Democrats in the race to focus more on the battleground states for the general election instead of the first states for the Democratic Primary. This mess in Iowa has to be a plus for his campaign. It is also worth mentioning that Bloomberg's odds will increase dramatically if Biden falls early and the party turns to the elder mayor as the best centrist alternative to Bernie (or Warren if she were to somehow surge past him which I view as very doubtful). An unforeseeable and totally botched process with Pete beating Bernie for #1 and Klobuchar beating Biden for #4 would be a better outcome in Iowa than Bloomberg could have reasonably hoped for.\n\n**Pete Buttigieg** may very well win the Iowa Caucus, and while he was projected to fair strongly in the state, I think most projections including [FiveThirtyEight ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/iowa/)had him finishing third behind Bernie and Biden in first and second in either order. I do not think Pete is capable of beating Bloomberg for the less left vote among Democrats, but it appears he was very capable of dealing Biden a strong early blow that could lead to his eventual knockout. I personally believe it will come down to Bernie and/or Bloomberg to face Trump for the presidency, but if Pete does end up coming out on top in Iowa, he is my distant third pick. Then again, he was most people's distant third pick for Iowa too.\n\n**Bernie Sanders** will now be the heavy favorite for the nomination regardless of whether he finishes first or second in Iowa with Biden having had the really poor showing that he did and Warren finishing materially below him as well. Bernie is projected to win in New Hampshire next and Nevada after that and if Biden continues to struggle in those states then a win in South Carolina may no longer be a foregone conclusion. I am still a bit concerned about Bernie physically after the heart attack that voters have seemed to forget about surprisingly quickly, but politically Bernie seems to be in very good shape.\n\n**Donald Trump** benefits from any situation that objectively looks bad for the Democratic Party. This was one of those situations, as was Nancy Pelosi's literally ripping his speech at the State of the Union Address, but in the bigger picture the delay of the Iowa Caucus results should not be of material significance come election time. The results themselves however will of course impact the determination of who Trump will be running against and in that regard it seems much less likely that candidate will be Biden today than it did a week ago. I will not speculate as to whether that is a plus or a minus for Trump's re-election bid, but if he would rather have faced Biden than Sanders or Bloomberg then it was not all good news out of Iowa for The President.\n\n**Amy Klobuchar** is neck and neck with Joe Biden based on what has been reported so far and if anyone tells you they predicted that I would not believe them without written proof. I said in a previous [post ](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/15/last-nights-debate/)that Klobuchar does not have a chance and this result does not change that but it is impressive nonetheless and rightly demands some acknowledgement and respect.\n\n**Honorable Mention** should be made of Elizabeth Warren who had a stronger than expected turnout, Andrew Yang who no one expected to be here at all, and the state of New Hampshire which most likely is going to look great so long as it goes more smoothly than Iowa, which I hope it does.\n\nIronically, my only experience in Iowa led me to be impressed by the state's technology and reporting mechanisms, though the story involved a better group of former candidates for president. My buddy Will and I and our other friend Cam were on route to Mount Rushmore as part of a two-week roadtrip after graduation when we made a pit stop for dinner in Iowa before a night's stay in Sioux Falls. My burger was just a bit better than alright, but I remember clearly observing that the on-table computer systems for placing our orders were phenomenal and surprisingly better than most similar technologies I had seen in cities like Nashville, San Francisco, and New York. It is unfortunate that Iowa's evident technological prowess as I observed it did not show well on Monday."}]}

We have found that around the six or seven week mark it has become more difficult to keep count. If it had not already, this quarantine period seems now to have earned itself recognition as its own chapter. It looks like it will be over soon, this first chapter of an unfamiliar and unpredictable era at least. I am optimistic that it will be for the best that we begin to go on offense now for a bit.\n\nBill Gates [predicted this pandemic five years ago in a TED Talk called \"The next outbreak? We're not ready.\"](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready?language=en) He seems like one of the better combinations of smarts, good intentions and the power of money and influence that we have in this world. I imagine we will be following his lead more than ever now that [he has stepped down from the board of Microsoft ](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51883377)and is [focusing the attention of his foundation exclusively on this pandemic for the foreseeable future](https://www.fastcompany.com/90497398/bill-gates-announces-his-foundation-will-focus-total-attention-on-covid-19-pandemic). The man who has been the richest in the world for most of my lifetime once famously said, “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.” In the face of this global crisis, we must be urgent, yes, but also patient. The world may not emerge from this as quickly as most of us would like it to, but when it does, it may be stronger than most of us could have imagined.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call  _The Weekend Miscellaneous_.\n\nGrilled Fries - It was another nice weekend of \"anything goes\" eating after another successful week on the \"hardly anything goes\" [program](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/21/the-gluten-free-vegan-diet-intermittent-fasting-and-green-smoothies/). I tried my hand at making french fries Friday night to compliment the burgers that my brother cooked up nicely on the grill. I cut two large potatoes precisely into fine and skinny slivers that I hoped would come out crispy once cooked. Next, I added four tablespooons of olive oil with an extra drizzle at the end for good measure. I thin-sliced two cloves of garlic from a fresh bulb while pretending I was Paul from Goodfellas like I do every time I slice garlic. Finally, I added a healthy amount of salt and pepper and a little onion powder before dumping them on some tin foil on the grill. Next time I would cook them in the oven to maintain the separation of fries and increase overall crispiness, but the grilled fries were mighty tasty nonetheless.\n\nElon on AI - I listened to a great podcast during my run on Saturday. Elon Musk was the guest on a show called [Artificial Intelligence with Lex Fridman](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-autopilot-and-the-pale-blue-dot/id1434243584?i=1000456599915). When people ask me for podcast recommendations, I generally point to these Monday posts which do a better job recollecting some good ones than my momentary memory does on its own. I also tell them that I find great episodes just as often by searching for people I want to hear speak as I do by depending on specific shows that I have saved. That was how I found this one on Saturday. I simply searched to find a podcast with Elon Musk. I am honestly blown away by his intelligence every time I hear him speak. In just 30 minutes on Saturday, he changed my perspective on Tesla, the human brain, and Earth itself. I expect to write more on these subjects soon.\n\n_Atomic Habits_ \\- At the recommendation of my buddy, McNulty, I started reading a book called _Atomic Habits_ this weekend. It is about building small habits that can have large impacts. McNulty's recommendation was serendipitous as I had coincidentally discovered the book and its author, James Clear, on Twitter the day prior. I am a little less than 100 pages into it and since I am all about habits I am finding it to be as interesting as any book I have read in the last few months. Granted, I have not read very many books this year. The truth is, I have never been an avid reader of books. One thing I am doing now in an effort to try to change that is to read without taking any notes, highlighting, underlining, or anything of the sort. My new approach stems from one of two good tips I learned from Naval Ravikant on reading. The first was to read what you love until you love to read. The second was specifically not to read for the purpose of learning, but rather, to simply read for the purpose of reading. Growing up, I rarely ever read books that were assigned for school or otherwise because the reading that was assigned was so significant and most of the books were not particularly interesting to me. Once I figured out I could succeed in class simply by following along with the discussion, I had no incentive to read books. Listening to and considering different people's different perspectives on something was generally more interesting to me than the thing itself anyway. I did not like having to read and I did not need to read to succeed, so I didn't. For some time now, I have been hoping to change that. I have read some books in the last three years, but I hope and believe that I have many more ahead. Now I am reading books I want to read because I want to read them, not because I have to. I have intentionally abandoned any efforts to retain information for the purpose of learning. Instead, I am trusting the process. I am reading to read.\n\nSunday Run - I figure it cannot hurt to end this edition of _The Weekend Miscellaneous_ with something slightly uncomfortable that some people might find funny at my expense. Yesterday, I ran for a little over an hour in an old cotton t-shirt outside in the pouring rain. When I got home and took my shirt off to get in the shower, I noticed a bit of pain and couple of unfamiliar stains. Sure enough, I looked down and found my nipples were bleeding. Avoid this if you can. It was as unfamiliar a site as it was unpleasant a sensation. Sufficed to say, I have learned my lesson about running in a cotton t-shirt in the rain."}]}

He found someone online who agreed to facilitate the delivery of two Papa John's pizzas to Laszlo's house in exchange for a cool 10,000 Bitcoins. When the pizza delivery took place in 2010, those 10,000 Bitcoins were worth about $40 in total. Today, 10,000 Bitcoins would be worth about $100 million. That is just over $6 million per slice.\n\nI would not feel too sorry for Laszlo. I imagine he held onto some Bitcoins and is doing just fine.\n\nSome people believe Bitcoin already had its big boom in 2017 when it climbed to a price that was about twice as high as it is today. Others believe this is still the beginning.\n\nLet me say that I will not be buying any pizzas with Bitcoin any time soon.\n\nFor anyone interested in reading a fundamentally informative perspective on Bitcoin from a highly respected investor, I recommend [this recently released letter from Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.scribd.com/document/460382154/May-2020-BVI-Letter-Macro-Outlook).

The only question is, to what degree?\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar, a [Rolling Fund is an AngelList-invented investment vehicle which allows GPs to raise funds publicly and quarterly](http://•\thttps://angel.co/blog/rolling-venture-fund-launch). For those who do not know what a GP is, a General Partner (\"GP\") in this case is an investor raising funds to invest in startups. You can think of GPs traditionally as venture capital firms. GPs raise funds from Limited Partners (\"LPs\"). You can think of LPs traditionally as large sources of money such as endowments, family offices, or high net worth individuals.\n\nThere is an ongoing trend in the startup investing ecosystem where it is becoming easier and more popular for individuals to succeed as GPs and/or LPs all on their own. These individual GPs and LPs have been coined [solo capitalists](https://nbt.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-solo-capitalists) and [micro-LPs](https://twitter.com/soonaorlater/status/1293620486757330945?s=20), respectively. Rolling funds seem poised to accelerate the rise of both solo capitalists and micro-LPs by making things easier and more attractive for each.\n\nFor solo capitalists (individual GPs), rolling funds shift the fundraising process from private to public, physical to digital, and periodic to recurring. Additionally, all of the administrative work is handled by AngelList so there is no friction in running a fund.\n\nNaval Ravikant, the Silicon Valley guru who came up with the idea for rolling funds, described their function simply -- [\"Raise anytime, raise anywhere.\"](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1291086539317841921) I might take this one step further to say -- \"Raise anytime, anywhere, from anyone, by any means.\" Admittedly, \"anyone\" really means any accredited investor and \"any means\" really means any means within the confines of the law, but it is close enough to demonstrate the power provided to solo capitalists by the innovation of rolling funds.\n\nBy eliminating the need for 280-day Sand Hill Road-shows and replacing them with 280-character tweets, rolling funds empower individuals with followings to become as formidable fundraisers and investors as traditional venture capital firms if they have the skill for it. Prime candidates for raising rolling funds include Twitter blue checks, Instagram influencers, and bloggers or podcasters or YouTubers with many subscribers, particularly those with demonstrable track records in investing or established expertise in a valuable niche.\n\nFor micro-LPs (small LPs), rolling funds decrease the price to play, increase startup exposure and portfolio diversity, and enable individuals to invest in other individuals, which could create a powerful loop.\n\n[Paul Anderson](https://twitter.com/paul_d_andersen/status/1291814451046277120) points out that a micro-LP can invest, for example, $5K in 5 GPs for 2 years. If each GP averages 10 investments per year, the LP gets a piece of 100 startups for their $200K of committed capital, which is typically what it would take to gain entry into a single VC fund. A single VC fund may well invest in 100 startups over the longer life of its fund but the diversity would not be as great nor the deployment as rapid as it would be by 5 rolling fund raising individuals investing in parallel. The commitment can also be shorter term (i.e. minimum 4 quarters) making it easier for micro-LPs who can be more agile than larger LPs to stop funding a GP and re-allocate their capital elsewhere practically at will.\n\nBeyond the impact that rolling funds will have on solo capitalists and micro-LPs, they may also make things easier for the startups themselves. On the one hand, rolling funds will accelerate the availability of capital from this new category of empathetic early-stage investors who startups can turn to instead of, or in addition to, more traditional VCs and angel investors. On the other hand, I could see rolling funds becoming roll models (misspelling intentional) for startups who may seek a way to raise less money with less effort on a recurring basis the same way that rolling funds are enabling solo capitalists to. While this may have seemed like an impossible structure to convince a traditional VC or angel investor to commit to only several months ago, it now seems at least feasible that startups could begin raising rolling rounds from rolling funds in the near future.\n\nI am excited to see how the innovation of rolling funds impacts early-stage investing. I would certainly consider raising one and investing in others if I had a larger following and was an accredited investor. Hopefully, one day soon I will have one, and I will be one.\n\n_For those who want to learn more about rolling funds, below are all of the resources I have read to date to gain my understanding of the innovation.
