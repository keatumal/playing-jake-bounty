Even I know relatively little about it in terms of all that there is to know, but I understand enough to feel like I get it. By that I mean that I feel I understand the fundamental power of its innovation and the magnitude of its potential. The below linked speech by Andreas Antonopoulos was what flipped the switch for me, from not getting it to getting it. It is the best introduction to Bitcoin that I have heard, by far, and you do not need any prior knowledge in technology, finance, or otherwise to gain understanding from it.\n\nAndreas’ speech ends at the 25 minute mark with a Q&A session thereafter. I recommend you find a time when you have at least 25 minutes if not the full 37 to watch or listen.\n\nI have included at the end of this post my brief notes exactly as I wrote them while watching the speech. It was not the first time that I had watched it. Since my notes are copied verbatim, they will not be very useful to you as a substitution for watching the video. They may be helpful for the purpose of recollection and as an imperfect summarization that you can refer back to after watching.\n\nHere is the YouTube link to Andreas’ speech: [“Introduction to Bitcoin”](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&ved=2ahUKEwiGxOnUw4PoAhWict8KHU3WA5kQwqsBMAh6BAgKEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dl1si5ZWLgy0&usg=AOvVaw223eYGO_0O6JKF0p-0Rkts)\n\nIf at any point after watching the video or otherwise you become interested in buying Bitcoin but do not know how, I have used Coinbase to buy mine. It is very easy and can be done in well under the time it takes to watch Andreas’ speech. You may click [this link](https://www.coinbase.com/join/aronwa_0) to get started. It is my referral link and gives you and I both a $10 bonus in Bitcoin when you buy $100 or more on Coinbase. Another popular alternative to buy Bitcoin that I would trust is the Cash App, but I have not yet used it to do so myself.\n\nI do not recommend beginning with an amount invested more than you are comfortable losing. I also do not recommend increasing your amount invested without increasing your understanding of the assets you are investing in and reasonably gaining conviction in the future value of those assets. I will note in writing that I do not believe Bitcoin’s value is currently the lowest it will ever be. Thus, do not blame me if your investment becomes worth less than the amount you invest. I am telling you quite bluntly that if you were to invest at the time I am writing this, I believe it would. That said, I am holding my investment in Bitcoin primarily because I believe it is many times closer to the lowest it will be in the next decade or two than it is to the highest it will be in that time, in terms of its percent change in value. If you are going to invest, please do so for your own reasons and acknowledge that it is at your own risk.\n\nNotes: Introduction to Bitcoin\n\n  * Platform of trust\n\n  * It is the concept of decentralization applied to the human communication of value\n\n  * Currency is just the first application of it\n\n  * Money pre-existed writing, first writing was tallying money\n\n  * Barter -> abstractions -> precious metals -> paper money -> plastic money -> network money\n\n  * Bitcoin is the first system of money not controlled by a single entity, completely decentralized\n\n  * Will do for money what internet did for communication\n\n  * Will not be embraced right away.

But it seems to me that there is some significant sacrifice required during the achievement of greatness. \n\nNo matter how many people claim they can do it all, I have doubts. Sure, Zuck and Bezos are jacked now. And yes, Steve Jobs seemed to have been a pretty good family man in the end. But these great founders were not how they later became during the years in which they rose to greatness. \n\nI’m not certain of what I am saying, that you can’t become a great founder without some significant sacrifice in fundamental dimensions of life such as health, relationships, and perhaps “happiness”. And it’s a dangerous idea if it’s wrong, because it is limiting upon one’s own idea of what is possible. I hesitate to share it for that reason. But what do I write for if it is not to share what I think?\n\nI share this idea because I am as pragmatic as I am optimistic, and this is a question I have considered for a long time.\n\nI think about it because I want to create something great, but I also want to be a great husband and a great father, and I want to live a long time, and I want to enjoy the ride. In other words, I want it all. \n\nAnd the optimist in me believes all these things are possible, together in parallel, in a single lifetime. But the pragmatist doubts whether that is true. So the optimist presses forward under the assumption that I can do it all while the pragmatist looks for signs of unavoidable sacrifice. \n\nIf sacrifice was required, and you knew that up front, at least you could make a conscious choice. More generally, if you could know what your various paths in life would look like, you could choose. But of course, you can’t. That’s not what life’s about, and I wouldn’t want it any other way. \n\nSo I move forward, knowing that I do not know, trusting my gut, and doing the best that I can.\n\nThe pragmatist started this writing but the optimist finishes. At the end of the day, I still believe it is possible that it is possible to do it all. I have my doubts, but without doubt, there is no place for faith. So that’s what I have. Faith."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Worldcoin\n\n_Worldcoin_ is a cryptocurrency on a mission to put its tokens \"in the palms of a billion people\" — perhaps eventually, every human on Earth. The company is building a privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol (\"PPPOPP\") with the ambitious objective of onboarding billions of people into the world of crypto and web3 via the worldcoin app and wallet. As per the mission, it will give these people free money in the form of worldcoin tokens (\"WLD\") to get on board, and that is just the beginning.\n\nSince the company was publicly announced [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1451214710628667394?s=20&t=devb3lRNqKIDKkYlMoF1Tw) on October 21, 2021, it has been bombarded by skeptics. Some of these skeptics may be genuinely concerned. Others seem superficially motivated by the status-upping satisfaction of scoring a \"kill\". Regardless, my objective in writing this particular piece is not to explore what could go wrong. Plenty of others have done that already. Rather, I will operate under the assumption that the team behind Worldcoin is sincerely seeking to build something useful and good for the world, that their reasoning is reasonable, that their technologies are (or will be) about as functional as they've been described, and that this big bet that they can get a billion users could actually work. In layman's terms, I will give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n_**How does it work?**_\n\nSo, how does Worldcoin actually work? Here is how it works from a prospective user’s point of view. First, you have to go out in the physical world and find a representative of Worldcoin who has the ability to onboard you to the protocol. In reality, right now there are only a few dozen of these representatives around the world, so it will probably be futile to go looking for one. Most likely, one of them will come to a place near you eventually, you will hear about it because it is their job to make sure you do, and then you can go to wherever they are, or maybe they will come to you. These representatives are called _Orb Operators_. An Orb Operator operates an _orb_. An orb is a cutting edge technological device designed and manufactured by Worldcoin to do a few specific things which in sum suffice to onboard new users and give them their Worldcoin wallets with some free tokens (WLD). \n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8a08628-fe82-4e43-9080-05d5567d7a8e_1024x731.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8a08628-fe82-4e43-9080-05d5567d7a8e_1024x731.jpeg)This is what an _orb_ looks like.\n\nHere is my high-level understanding of what exactly the orb does, in practical, non-technical terms. First, it scans a person's eyes, specifically their iris, and uses that naturally unique human biometric to generate a different and separate unique identifier, a simple string of letters and numbers. Assuming that unique identifier is not already in the system (if it was, that would mean this person has already been onboarded), it is converted to what can be thought of as a fungible digital ticket. This ticket is used to claim a new wallet. The multi-step process is in place to ensure two layers of privacy protection. The wallet cannot be reverse matched to the unique identifier nor can the unique identifier be reverse matched to the iris scan, which is deleted after it is used. This is what makes it a privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol. The fact that only a living human's iris may be used to generate a new wallet ensures that each wallet represents an individual person and that no one person may create more than one wallet. The multi-step process uses zero-knowledge proofs to preserve privacy as this is done.\n\n_**Why does it matter?**_\n\nSo, what is the point of a privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol, what is the problem it aims to solve, and why is that an important problem to solve? The point is to prove that a particular wallet address is the only wallet address on that protocol representing a certain individual person. The problems that this solves are of the sort we see caused by spam bots and [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). A Sybil attack is essentially when a bad actor creates a bunch of bots in order to gain outsized influence within a network. There are a number of useful things that are hard or impossible to do because the problem of preventing Sybil attacks has not been solved.\n\nHere is one example. Imagine a decentralized autonomous organization (\"DAO\") wants to make decisions in a decentralized and maximally democratic manner. The DAO would like to give every person in its community one vote on every issue. In an attempt to achieve this, they could give a vote to every Ethereum wallet that connects with their website, but this would be imperfect at best and entirely ineffective at worst, depending on how successful some people may be in seeking to gain an unfair advantage by obtaining the ability to vote multiple times. For instance, If there were 100 people in the community and 1 of them really wanted a particular decision to be made, he could create 99 wallets in addition to his first, connect them all with the website, vote 100 times, and ensure that his decision wins assuming the other 99 people in the community do not try something similar themselves. Voting is just one example of something that is hard to do without Sybil resistance but becomes more practically possible with a working proof-of-personhood protocol like Worldcoin purports it can be, and not just one person one vote voting, but innovative alternatives like [quadratic voting](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) as well.\n\nAnother example of something made feasible by a working proof-of-personhood protocol is Universal Basic Income (\"UBI\"). Imagine some government, organization, individual, or group wanted to provide a UBI for everyone in the world in a future where artificial general intelligence (\"AGI\") has rendered many humans jobless. Surely we would not want to give bad actors multiples more money than others simply because they are able to appear as if they are many individual people. Again, the ability to prove that a unique address represents a unique and individual person becomes useful. As a third example, if a new product wants to incentivize users to sign up by giving them $10, they could do that with a proof-of-personhood protocol. Without this or something like this, they might risk giving many bonuses to bots created by an individual with no intention of actually trying the product. The list of unlocked opportunities goes on. \n\nCurrently, there are of course some attempted solutions to this general category of problems. There are Know Your Customer (\"KYC\") services which leverage government-issued passports, IDs, facial scans, and the like to prove a person is who they say they are, and there are CAPTCHAs (those 4 by 4 panel pictures that ask you to \"select all the squares with traffic lights\") to separate people from bots, but these and other solutions are insufficient to unlock the full range of possibilities on a global scale, nor to do it in a decentralized manner. It is estimated that [1 billion people globally do not have any proof of identity](https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/global-identification-challenge-who-are-1-billion-people-without-proof-identity), and while a CAPTCHA shows that you are not a robot, it does not show that you haven't been through that CAPTCHA before.\n\n_**How is it going?**_\n\nNow that we have some understanding of what Worldcoin is and why it matters, let us consider its current adoption. Here are some approximate numbers as of early summer 2022 according to a number of public sources including articles and podcasts. There are around 30 Orb Operators, each with an orb, operating in about 24 different countries. They have onboarded about 700,000 users, who can be thought of as beta testers, as we understand things are not yet working entirely as they eventually are expected to, and these beta testers will have the opportunity to onboard again once everything goes live. It looks like it took roughly 6 months to get the first 100,000 onboarded (as per the chart below) and another 6 months to get the next 600,000 -- not a bad little growth curve.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42710d6a-87df-42a6-94f5-6c15da1b881d_1024x528.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42710d6a-87df-42a6-94f5-6c15da1b881d_1024x528.jpeg)https://twitter.com/sama/status/1451203161029427208\n\n _**Where is it going?**_\n\nThe company is estimating it will have onboarded several million users by the end of 2022, which would require the continued acceleration of a growth curve that has already been quite impressive to date. For some added perspective, it is estimated that there are between [100](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/blockchain-stats) and [300 million](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/cryptocurrency-statistics/) crypto users globally, so it could be that nearly 10% of all crypto users worldwide will have Worldcoin wallets by the end of this year if the company hits its ambitious projections. Early Orb Operators have onboarded around 700 or 800 people per week and in some cases more than 2,000. While there are only about 30 orbs out there today, Worldcoin projects to distribute between 1,000 and 2,000 by the end of this year, and expects to scale production to around 50,000 new orbs in 2023, perhaps producing even more orbs on an annual basis thereafter. If all goes well, Worldcoin considers it within reach that they may scale to 1 billion users in just a few years, and while this may seems like an awfully lofty target, even meeting it halfway for 500 million users would represent around double the number of all crypto users globally today.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3604720-1564-45ce-82e6-399478501d41_1023x557.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3604720-1564-45ce-82e6-399478501d41_1023x557.png)An illustrative model of how Worldcoin could grow to several million users by EOY 2022 and nearly a billion by EOY 2025.\n\n_**How will it get there?**_\n\nWhen it comes to Worldcoin's innovations, naturally, most people's attention will be fixed on the science-fiction-looking orb. It sounds as impressive as it looks given that the team evidently had to invent something better than Apple's face scanning technology or anything else in existence. That said, Worldcoin's decentralized salesforce of Orb Operators may end up looking like just as critical an innovation as any if they are as successful with scaling as they hope to be. If the company can continue to contract highly motivated and resourceful entrepreneur-types from around the world to distribute Worldcoin in their local regions as or more effectively as the early Orb Operators have done to date, the protocol might just have a shot at onboarding those tens or hundreds of millions, even billions of users that they plan to. \n\nIt will likely be as challenging as it will be important to align the incentives of these Orb Operators with everyone else involved with the protocol so that they will use acceptable methods to get people signed up. Ideally, newly onboarded users will understand what Worldcoin is about and thus be more likely to engage with what they are signing up for. Could it be that Orb Operators by the end of this decade are almost as prevalent as Uber drivers (3-4 million)? Probably not, but Worldcoin might not need one-tenth that many to reach substantially every human in the world and onboard them to the Worldcoin protocol. Some of the most successful venture capitalists, individual investors, and entrepreneurs in crypto certainly seem to believe Worldcoin has a shot. Firms and individuals including a16z, Khosla Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, and Multicoin Capital, among many others have invested $125 million in Worldcoin over its last two rounds, most recently at a valuation of $3 billion. Suffice to say, capital should not be the thing that constrains them from getting off to a very nice start.\n\n_**What's next?**_\n\nWorldcoin has begun a process and published a roadmap proclaiming that they will eventually be [open sourcing everything](https://worldcoin.org/open-sourcing-worldcoin). Its leadership has discussed the concept of progressive decentralization and their goals for community governance in the long-run. Once the protocol is live after mainnet launch, the potential for projects to utilize this privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol seems unbound. Could we all start \"earning\" UBI before we die? What might an open global userbase of billions of proven-to-be-unique people enable the next generation of great organizations to offer? What could this mean for democracy? If only there was somewhere we could look to see the future… perhaps in the eye of an orb."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Introducing: Purple People\n\nI am excited to announce a new podcast in addition to my existing podcast _([Pod of Jake](https://podofjake.com)), _which I plan to continue unaffected. The new one is called _**[Purple People](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/purple-people/id1771300254)**_. For this podcast, I will be having conversations with some of the most interesting people on [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/). The only criteria is that the guest is on Farcaster. So I expect the guests and our conversations to be as wide-ranging as the people on Farcaster and their interests. Of course, there are certain areas of interest such as crypto which are common across most of the people on the network. And I expect Farcaster itself will be a frequent topic of conversation. But we will certainly not be talking about crypto or Farcaster all the time. I am much more interested in talking about all sorts of things.\n\n**The People of Farcaster**\n\nThis podcast scratches two itches which I have had for at least one and three years, respectively. The first was to start a podcast focused purely on the people of Farcaster. I think Farcaster is an interesting network of people which can continue to grow in quantity while retaining some of its early community's common qualities such as civility and curiosity. Ultimately, I believe Farcaster has the potential to become the power law leading, sufficiently decentralized social network of the future. More importantly, I generally enjoy meeting and talking to new people I meet on Farcaster, and I hope to meet many more as a result of starting this podcast.\n\n**Walking Recordings**\n\nThe second itch was to figure out a way to record podcasts while walking outside and still retaining a high enough audio quality so as not to be less than satisfactory for the average podcast listener. I think I finally figured it out. So I plan to record most, if not all, _Purple People_ episodes while walking outside using my [Ray-Ban Meta glasses](https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/wayfarer-matte-black-graphite-polar) to record. If you are aware of a better walking recording device, let me know what it is. Otherwise, I am as surprised as you are to find that a pair of glasses ended up being the form factor which, after years of sporadically searching, finally seems to have satisfied my criteria for a lightweight, high-quality audio device I can use on the move. Fittingly, I was recommended the glasses by one of my good friends from Farcaster, [@phil](https://warpcast.com/phil/0x6427c7c7).\n\n**Minimum Preparation, Maximum Spontaneity**\n\nBeyond the fact that it will be focused on Farcaster people and recorded while I am walking, _Purple People_ will differentiate from _Pod of Jake_ in a few other ways as well. Most significantly, I will intentionally limit my preparation for each episode for the sake of enabling myself to do more of them and seeing what happens when the conversations are maximally spontaneous. Unlike an episode of _Pod of Jake_ for which I might prepare anywhere between a couple of hours and a couple of weeks, I expect to limit my explicit preparation for an episode of _Purple People_ to a maximum of 30 minutes. I am optimistic about how these conversations may differ as a result. I don’t know that they will necessarily be “better”, as if conversations could be judged so objectively anyway, but I do expect that they will be substantially different. I expect the increase in spontaneity to lead the conversations in less expected directions, with my questions coming more purely from a place of curiosity than an intention to drive the conversation in certain directions I have predetermined might be interesting (which, to be fair, still comes from a place of curiosity in the first place).\n\n**Other Small Differences**\n\nSince I will be walking while recording, I will be recording _Purple Purple_ as an audio-only podcast just as I did for the first 140 episodes of _Pod of Jake_(since then, I have included video as well for most episodes). I have always preferred recording podcasts [audio-only](https://www.blogofjake.com/p/audio-only-is-underrated?r=428ww) for a number of reasons, so I am excited to return to that simpler format as opposed to forcing the addition of video. Another small difference is that I will not commit to a publishing cadence as I do with _Pod of Jake,_ where I have expected myself to publish an episode every week or two for the last 4 years, and roughly have done so with some exceptions here and there. I want _Purple People_ to feel low pressure and just for fun. So I want to strip out any unfun parts of the process, most notably the various parts of post-production and publishing, which I mostly have minimized for my main podcast already, but will seek to do even moreso for Purple People. I don’t enjoy editing or making clips or doing the kind of overhead-type work that most people consider a prerequisite for getting an episode published. And I don't think it really matters either. So I’ll decide what matters and what doesn’t for myself and I will aim to release the conversations I record as simply and as quickly as possible for anyone who wants to be able to listen to them anytime.\n\n**In Closing**\n\nI officially decided to start this podcast [a week ago](https://warpcast.com/jake/0xb4502c28). Since then, I have set everything up and recorded a few episodes. My next step is to publish the first one. I could have never predicted all of the good things which have come from starting my original podcast, _Pod of Jake_. So now, as I start this new podcast, I am excited about the unpredictable potential for _Purple People._\n\n**If this sounds interesting, you can subscribe to the** _**[Purple People](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/purple-people/id1771300254)**_**podcast on[Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/purple-people/id1771300254) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/7msbH2I7i6ZXIam7RPEsVC). **\n\nThank you for reading, and if you do decide to tune in, thank you for the listening."}]}

I feel now as if everything I have ever done and every decision I have ever made was worthwhile because it brought me here to where I am now, and there is nowhere I would rather be. To me, it goes to show the benefit of believing that [everything happens for a reason](https://blogofjake.com/2020/10/16/the-benefits-of-believing-everything-happens-for-a-reason/), that if you seek to make the best of things, if you keep a positive attitude, if you stay patient and persistent, and if you have faith, it all works out in the end.\n\nOf course, this is only the very beginning of my story, but it is also the end of a chapter and the culmination of all those that came before it. I think about my most recent chapter in three parts. I first spent a couple of months traveling, then several months writing, and finally several more podcasting. Not to suggest that I did not have any [down days](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/30/the-worst-times-get-better/) along the way – like everyone, I did – but generally speaking, I loved all of it. I got to explore Paris, Copenhagen, Japan, and [Israel](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/26/birthright-10-days-in-israel/). I got to write this blog that thousands of people from over 100 countries cared to read. And I got to record more than 50 podcasts with some truly [amazing guests](https://podofjake.com/), which I expect to continue to do, only at a slightly slower pace.\n\nA few other themes from the last year come to mind. I picked up the habit of [running](https://blogofjake.com/2020/04/09/reasons-to-run/) and ran over 600 miles last year, including my first marathon on my [26th birthday](https://blogofjake.com/2020/06/24/26/). I got accustomed to a much lower cost of living which helped me to be [profitably unemployed](https://blogofjake.com/2020/08/03/profitably-unemployed/). I probably read more books and listened to more podcasts than I previously had in the rest of my life combined. I started [tweeting](https://twitter.com/blogofjake) and met some amazing people from around the world while discovering that being authentic on the internet could bring me great [luck](https://blogofjake.com/2020/11/30/make-your-own-luck/). Between some bonus time living at home with my family and many months spent in Airbnbs with Lauren, I got to live in South Carolina, New York, Tennessee, New Jersey, and Georgia, all for at least a month.\n\nIt has been an amazing 18 months, but I firmly believe this next chapter is going to be my best yet.\n\nI hope you will follow along at [x]. I believe it is going to be something special.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support. I feel so fortunate and grateful.\n\n\\- Jake"}]}

It is not easy, but it is certainly a whole lot easier than I thought it would be. It has also become easier week after week and my growing conviction in the practice has enabled me to stick with it without much temptation to quit or make significant alterations to the original plan. One small alteration that I have made is removing Sunday dinner from the \"on\" period that I defined as Sunday dinner through Friday lunch when I started. I found that it is much easier for me to make the first meal of the \"on\" period a smoothie on Monday after the first of five consecutive 16-hour dinner-to-noon fasts for the week which passively initiates my \"on\" period. This change gives me the freedom to eat whatever I want for dinner on Sunday and that tends to be a more enjoyable way to close the weekend than with rice and beans.\n\nIf you assume the normal 3 meals per day, which I do not necessarily abide by, my new practice works out to a 2:1 ratio in terms of \"on\" time (3 meals Monday through Thursday + 2 meals Friday = 14 meals \"on\") vs. \"off\" time (1 meal Friday + 3 meals Saturday and Sunday = 7 meals \"off\"). Of course, the \"off\" meals do not need to be comprised of totally unhealthy things, but the point is to give weekend freedom and overall balance to the practice. I choose to use that freedom for things like good pizza, pasta, bacon and eggs, burgers, and sushi, not so much for garbage like Fritos or soda.\n\nOne of the unforeseen positives of this practice for me has been how much I enjoy my weekend meals now. For foods I already loved, the new scarcity of my consumption has only made them more holy. Conversely, by the end of the weekend (but not before Sunday dinner), I have always felt ready and even excited to get back on the program on Monday.\n\nThe quantity and diversity of amazing places to eat in New York City is one of the things I love the most about it. For anyone interested in discovering new restaurants in the city, I will write briefly about a few of those places that I enjoyed this weekend below.\n\n[Mud Spot](https://www.mudnyc.com/) \\- hearty set meal brunch with a mimosa, beer or OJ and a mud drip coffee for about $25 all in. The coffee is strong and dark as the name of the spot suggests. The atmosphere feels like it belongs in a Colorado ski town with its lodge-like interior and classic rock music. It is a good vibe. I went with my brother and we sat and drank coffee well beyond the check.\n\n[Bua ](https://www.buabar.com/)\\- dinner options priced in the low teens include burgers, fried chicken sandwiches, and more. All of them are written on a board on the wall in addition to the menus on the table. I like that. The fried chicken sandwich was delicious. The bar side of the restaurant was pretty packed with boozers. The restaurant side had a 15-20 minute wait which we gladly withstood for a table. They played a couple songs by A Tribe Called Quest as well as Outkast's [SpottieOttieDopaliscious](https://open.spotify.com/track/4GdB5M7GbwLZLouktYocFC) which cemented the deal for me personally. I went with Neil, Ben, and Albert who deserves credit for picking the place. The three of them were my fellow analysts in the New York office when I worked for Houlihan. We had a great time and the pressure is on for whoever picks the place we go next.\n\n[La Pizza & La Pasta at Eataly NYC Flatiron](https://www.eataly.com/us_en/stores/nyc-flatiron/nyc-la-pizza-la-pasta/) \\- solid to great pizza and pasta within the most comprehensive and authentic Italian market that I know in the city. This was not my first time in Eataly but before my first time I had always assumed it would be somewhat commercial given the name. That is definitely not the case. It is totally legit and the closest thing I have seen to [Mercado Centrale](https://www.mercatocentrale.com/florence/), my incredible makeshift dining hall during my semester in Florence. Lunch Sunday was with Kyle who I mentioned in [this post](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/04/the-shortcomings-of-a-salary-mindset/) last week. His pasta came out a few minutes before my pizza and we decided once and for all that the tradition of waiting for everyone to have their food served before anyone can eat is utterly ridiculous and entirely impractical. Having sat on both sides of the stupidity countless times, I can say for certain that the person with the food generally wants to eat it and the person everyone is waiting for wants them to eat it because it is awkward and uncomfortable to sit and wait while everyone is waiting for you to get your food. If no one wants it, why do we wait. I understand of course if the food is all coming out at once and you are talking about a matter of seconds, but if it is going to be more than a minute or a few, everyone should eat."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# The Art of the Cold Email\n\n_**Part 1 - How to find almost anyone’s email in less than 1 minute:**_\n\nStep 1 - Once you know who you want to email, find the website of the person’s employer.\n\nStep 2 - Go to hunter.io (sign up for a free account), enter the website from Step 1, and skim the first few results to determine the most common email syntax.\n\n_Note - using the name John Smith as an example, I find that about 90% of the time it is either john.smith@, johnsmith@, or john@. Most of the rest of the time it is either johns@, smithj@, somehow involves a middle initial, or is generally unguessable or not worth the time to figure out unless the hunter.io results make clear the harder to guess syntax._\n\nStep 3 - For better than 90% of people, you should now have a best guess email address that will work better than 75% of the time.\n\n_Note - if your first guess does not work, go back to hunter.io and see if there were any other common syntaxes, or else make educated guesses based on my note above. Mailtester.com can be used to test email addresses rather than sending and getting them bounced, however, it is only sometimes useful (all green means confirmed, any red means failed, and often it is green & yellow which doesn’t tell you one way or the other)._\n\n_**Part 2 - Considerations for the cold email:**_\n\nAnyone who has recruited for an internship or job in investment banking or another networking necessary industry likely is already familiar with some version of the process above. It is not at all difficult or complex. What is difficult is getting people to respond, so what is complex is trying to figure out how best to do so. After sending hundreds of cold emails, being fortunate enough to get a job in banking, and then receiving hundreds more, I have come across one important realization and a few things I believe one can do to improve the rate of response on cold emails.\n\nMy important realization was that regardless of what you say in the subject or body of your electronic mail, the outcome of whether the person responds or not is entirely up to and dependent on that person, not you. You can write the perfect email, whatever that looks like, but if the person to whom you are sending it is home sick vomiting with a fever while simultaneously running behind on a project that is totally consuming their week, you simply are not going to get a response. This is important to remember so as not to waste too much time striving for perfection. I hear a lot of successful people saying done is better than perfect. That certainly applies here.\n\nThat said, the few things that I do believe you can do to give yourself the best rate of response in aggregate are as follows:\n\n1\\. **Keep it brief.** This person does not care about you, not even enough to care to read about why you are telling them they should care about you. They get these emails all the time and they all look mostly the same. It is bold to be brief. No one ever lost interest and stopped reading halfway through a tweet. Use that length as a parameter.\n\n2\\. **Attach your resume.** Since you are keeping the email brief, you will not have room to tell them much if anything about yourself. Attach your resume in case you are lucky enough to get their attention and interest in who you are. They might care enough to open it but not enough to ask for it, and they might respond if they like it but they won’t like it if they never see it. To avoid wasting a sentence telling the person my resume is attached, I often either put “ _(resume attached)_ ” after my name at the end or don’t mention it all. They can see the attachment.\n\n3\\. **Check the time.** Jeffery Fox in his book _How to Become a Rainmaker_ says the best time to sell is on Friday afternoon. This has stuck with me for years and in many regards I buy it. People are happy on Friday afternoons and they tend to be open and careless and kind. At the same time, some people also will stop checking their email for the weekend and may not want to give you the time of day on a precious Friday so I like to send emails Thursday afternoons as well. I stay away from most mornings when people generally like to get cracking on their to-do lists and are less tolerant of distractions. I especially stay away from Monday mornings, the most generally hated time of the week. Don’t worry too much about it because you never know. Just take a moment to put yourself in the person’s shoes and think about timing for a second.\n\n4\\. **Be persistent.** You will not annoy anyone by following up on your first email even if the person does not respond. No one cares. Emails from anyone can be annoying for everyone. The person is not going to hold a personal vendetta against you. You have nothing to lose and it is unlikely they will even remember your name. If you were emailing me, however, I have found that a second email from the same person makes me more inclined to respond. I respect persistence in almost any case and this has worked on my behalf as well. Ask for what you want, and then ask again.\n\nIn closing, these are the things that I think about when I send cold emails, and my cold emails tend to work well, better than most I can confidently say. I have made connections with billionaires, bankers, venture capitalists, CEOs, authors, and others through cold emails. Don’t be afraid to reach out to anyone. Email the CEO instead of an associate. When it comes to the cold email, as with so many other things, it pays to have guts. Good luck."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Don’t count the days\n\nThe title of this post is borrowed from the first half of one of my favorite quotes. It was Muhammad Ali who once said, “Don’t count the days. Make the days count.”\n\nI do not remember where I was when I first learned that Muhammad Ali died, but I do distinctly remember seeing the news on the cover of a paper in a yellow newspaper box on the streets of San Francisco in the summer of 2016. It was while taking some time to watch old videos and read about the “The Greatest” after his death that I discovered the quote. I have never been one to put inspirational quotes up around my desk, but that summer I wrote Ali’s words on my mousepad so that I would remember every day not to count the days but to make them count.\n\nCounting down the days until the weekend is a widely accepted norm. Most people do it some of the time and some people do it most of the time. Over the course of my life, I have certainly been no exception. People count down the time until other things as well, like the number of days until summer as a kid, or Thanksgiving and the extended break from work that comes with it, or Christmas, vacation, a birthday, or retirement.\n\nIt is totally fine to look forward to things. In fact, I think life benefits from a sense of excitement in thinking about the future, but not at the expense of spending the interim with a “get through” attitude in which one is simply counting down the days, wishing they were going by faster, or worst of all, complaining that they are not going by fast enough.\n\nIt should seem obvious that counting down the days is not a good way to live, but still, most of us do it anyway. Why? Because we do not feel that we have a choice. To be fair, sometimes we may not, but most of the time we do. Most of the time, we simply prioritize certain things more highly. We want things more than we want not to count the days. We do not like changes, especially when they carry a lot of unknown and would not be guaranteed to change the fact that we are counting down the days in the first place. We get tired of thinking about the things that we could change to solve the problem because it is a hard problem to solve and most everyone else is dealing with it so we can deal with it too, we reason. We find some satisfactory justification for counting down the days without feeling bad about it or at least an excuse to stop thinking about doing something to change it. In doing so, we can usually kick the can down the road and put the problem off another few weeks or months or years until eventually we get so accustomed to counting down the days that the alternative becomes too foreign to even imagine anymore. It becomes only a dream we once had. This, of course, is speculative on my part. I am too young to have had all of that happen and unfold in my life personally, but that is how I could imagine things might play out. I hope and trust that they will not play out that way for me.\n\nInstead of living of a life in which we are counting down the days and putting off doing anything to change that, I would argue that we should take action when, for too many days, for too long a time, we find ourself counting down the days. If we cannot change our thinking in our current circumstances, which we may well be able to do, then we need to change our circumstances in whatever ways we can, small or large.\n\nDays are simply a unit of time, and a useful one to think about since it is about as natural as they come with the rising and setting of the sun. After a certain number of sunrises and sunsets, we all die eventually, and the question of whether we would like to count down the days until then, or to make them count, seems to be one with an obvious answer.\n\nI know when I am making my days count because I feel like there is not enough time in the day, not to do the things that I have to do or the things that make me feel stressed or negative, but to do the things that I want to do, the things that make me feel purpose or pleasure or positive.\n\nTo me, Muhammad Ali shared with us a fundamental way to go about our days, and for that I am grateful to The Greatest. I am far from perfect at it, but generally I do my best not to count the days and to make the days count. At a time like this, it is especially easy to fall into the trap of counting down the days, to the end of this month when social distancing guidelines are in effect in the US, or to a fictitious future when everything will suddenly go back to normal. There may be nothing worse to count the days until than a miracle.\n\nSome days are flat out bad and sometimes those days can stretch to weeks and months and during those times it is much harder to make the days count and much easier to remember that [the worst times get better](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/30/the-worst-times-get-better/). That is okay too. But if you think about your circumstances and cannot think of a way to explain them to someone in which they would feel sorry for you, then this is probably as good a time as any to start thinking about what you can do to make your days count instead of counting them, and to do it."}]}

I am doing that today because this 5-minute speech demands it.\n\nWatch and listen to these words from Julia Jackson, the mother of Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old man who was shot from behind seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin this past weekend. Yesterday, I wrote about [our divided nation](https://blogofjake.com/2020/08/25/uniting-the-divided-states-of-america/) and how it could benefit from more civility, sincerity, and respect.

If Jacob knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased. So I'm really asking and encouraging everyone in Wisconsin and abroad to take a moment and examine your hearts.\n> \n> Citizens, police officers, firemen, clergy, politicians-- do Jacob justice on this level and examine your hearts. We need healing. As I pray for my son's healing physically, emotionally, and spiritually, I also have been praying, even before this, for the healing of our country.\n> \n> God has placed each and every one of us in this country because he wanted us to be here. Clearly you can see by now that I have beautiful, brown skin. But take a look at your hand. And whatever shade it is, it is beautiful as well.\n> \n> How dare we hate what we are. We are humans. God did not make one type of tree or flower or fish or horse or grass or rock. How dare you ask him to make one type of human that looks just like you. I'm not talking to just Caucasian people. I am talking to everyone-- white, black, Japanese, Chinese, red, brown. No one is superior to the other. The Only Supreme being is God himself.\n> \n> Please, let's begin to pray for healing for our nation. We are the United States. Have we been united? Do you understand what's going to happen when we fall because a house that is against each other cannot stand? To all those police officers, I'm praying for you and your families. To all of the citizens, my black and brown sisters and brothers, I'm praying for you. I believe that you are an intelligent being just like the rest of us, everybody. Let's use our hearts, our love, and our intelligence to work together to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other. America is great when we behave greatly. Thank you.\n> \n> Julia Jackson, 08/25/2020"}]}

Unfortunately, there are and will continue to be many more of those people than usual as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic impact that is costing tens of millions of Americans their jobs. This sudden loss of income for masses of people is especially concerning when paired with the fact that, [according to the Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2018-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201905.pdf), about 40% of Americans would struggle to cover an unexpected expense of just $400. Obviously, this hypothetical unexpected expense of $400 does not come close to equating with the unexpected loss of one's entire income that has become the reality for people all across America. I wrote about [the eleven human needs ](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/31/the-eleven-human-needs/)earlier this week and I started this fundraiser because I am concerned that many people will struggle to satisfy them now, specifically by not being able to afford enough food. You can visit the official website here:\n\nIf and when you do, please take a minute to read the full fundraiser description to learn more about what exactly you can do to help.\n\nLastly, I understand and am humbled by the fact that I am writing to an audience that is much more global than I would have expected it to be at this point when I first started writing last December. I encourage those from other countries to focus on the problems hitting closest to home, and for any Americans with higher priority issues, I encourage them to do the same. If you do care about this cause in particular, however, or if you would just like to run, walk, help fundraise or donate to support a great cause, your efforts will by no means be taken for granted.\n\nThank you sincerely for anything you can do to help."}]}

It was 45 or 50 degrees with what felt like the strongest sun of the decade so far, that in reference to the new decade into which we are only 8 weeks of course.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call _The Weekend Miscellaneous_.\n\n[Motorino ](https://www.motorinopizza.com/)\\- my favorite pizza in New York if I am ever pressed to give just one. That is much too high of an expectation to take into the restaurant if you do decide to go, but it is what I say. You can expect a Neopolitan Pizza with dough so fundamental that I can only describe it as doughy. It has airy dark bubbles on the crust and just enough char on the bottom from the brick oven in the back. The cheese is quality but the way it melts with the remarkably sweet red sauce to make a pink juice that I would drink out of a cup is what makes it an excellent pizza. While the margherita is the obvious highlight, I also like that they usually bring out a few small circles of salami on the house to get you started, and that my buddy Will and I were able to walk in at prime time on a Friday night and get a table without a wait.\n\n[Primal Fear](https://www.netflix.com/title/873159) \\- awesome movie about a lawyer who takes a case defending an altar boy accused of brutally murdering a Chicago priest after being caught literally red-handed (as well as red-clothed and red-faced) running from the scene of the crime. It was Ed Norton's film debut as the accused murderer and he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor as a result of it. Richard Gere as the lead and a who's who cast of women were also great in their respective roles and the movie earned my strong recommendation for anyone who does not mind movies based around a court case or made in the 90's. I always say that 1996 was the best year for movies when I see one, but I say that about 1997 and 1998 too. From that triennium, Good Will Hunting, Swingers, Saving Private Ryan, The Truman Show, and the underrated comedy Liar Liar are five of my favorites.\n\n[Frank ](https://www.frankrestaurant.com/)\\- Italian restaurant with outdoor seating where my buddy Cole and I had a solid brunch on Saturday. Fennel in addition to parmesan seemed unique as an ingredient for an omelette but the combination was unsurprisingly tasty, as are most things with parmesan. A $16 three-for-one drinks option (which I realize would be more like a regularly priced order for three drinks in a less expensive city) gave us no choice but to get three bellinis a piece. The bellini to me is a better version of a mimosa that uses peach puree instead of orange juice. The drink was invented at Harry's in Venice where I was fortunate to try my first one. Harry's was opened by Giuseppe Cipriani whose name you see around New York, most famously in the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal.\n\n[Peppi's Cellar ](https://www.peppiscellar.com/)\\- a somewhat hidden restaurant bar under the fancier Gran Tivoli restaurant in SoHo where I went with my friends Rob & Chris on Saturday night. I would not go back for dinner but it is a cool spot for drinks. Nothing on the cocktail menu caught my eye so it was mezcal negronis for me.\n\n[B&H Dairy](https://www.yelp.com/biz/b-and-h-dairy-new-york-2) \\- went and sat at the counter for a very late Sunday brunch after a very long morning run. Many people dread the idea of eating out alone and I don't do too much of it these days but I used to do it all the time in San Francisco when I was living by myself and didn't know too many people. The thing about eating out alone is that it has as much to do with where you go as anything else. For example, you don't go to a hot bottomless brunch spot on a Sunday afternoon looking for a meal without company. That's a nightmare. You go to a place that is mostly counterspace, off-beat and unpacked like B&H. You can get in and out for $10 including tip if you stick to two eggs & a pound of potatoes with buttered challah on the side, but I got a vegetable juice as well and I want to go back for the soups. Fair warning that it is vegetarian and so if you find yourself in need bacon, B&H is not the move.\n\n[Málà Project ](https://www.malaproject.nyc/)\\- a Michelin Guide spot for Chinese dry pots at a reasonable price between $15-25 per person. I went with my brother Sunday night and while I wrote in [this post](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/10/updated-eating-practices-places-to-eat-in-nyc/) how I moved the start of my gluten-free vegan weeks to Monday mornings instead of Sunday nights, this was a place I did not have a desire to go off program. A reasonably accurately named \"mild\" dry pot with wood ear mushrooms, bamboo shoots, firm tofu, and bok choy was fresh, hot, and delicious with a side of white rice. We were able to walk in on Sunday at 7 and it is right around the corner so I am sure we will be back.\n\n[Osteria delle Tre Panche](https://www.osteriadelletrepanche.com/en) \\- even though I went here Tuesday night as a weeknight exception this place must be mentioned as a restaurant from Florence which has been in New York for most of the month of February at [Chef's Club NY](https://www.chefsclub.com/new-york/). I went with friends with whom I had previously been to the restaurant in Florence when we all studied abroad there. Tre Panche means Three Benches and it is named as it is because of the three long benches that comprise the seating area in the restaurant. The temporary New York location was much larger, still fully booked, and a bit over-priced. Still, we got what we went for which was a couple of their mouth-watering truffle dishes for which the restaurant is known. The truffle ravioli, truffle chicken, and truffle mozzarella grilled-cheese-like appetizer were far and away the best dishes on our table where everything was shared. If you are ever in Florence and you like the taste of truffle, go get yourself a bench. It will be worth it.\n\nObviously this was a big foodie weekend for me. I cannot overemphasize how much more enjoyable these weekend meals have been made by the discipline with which I have been intermittent fasting and eating on a gluten-free vegan diet during the weekdays (and doing so very economically as well). Several weeks in now I am still learning and tweaking for improvements but the balance of the system has been great and I do not have any urge whatsoever not to continue with [the program](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/21/the-gluten-free-vegan-diet-intermittent-fasting-and-green-smoothies/). If it is something you would be open to considering, I would highly recommend giving it a one week try."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Finding Meaning in the Absurd\n\nI stumbled upon an old essay yesterday. I wrote it 5 years ago in school. The essay was for a philosophy class called _Intro to Ethics_. I liked the class a lot, partly because I did well in it. This essay got an A. It was about finding meaning in life. I called it _Finding Meaning in the Absurd_. It is when life seems most absurd that it becomes most difficult and important to find meaning in it. For many people around the world, life has never felt quite as absurd as it does right now. This felt like a serendipitous time for me to stumble upon my old essay, and a sensible time for me to share it. I hope you find it worth your time to read.\n\nFinding Meaning in the Absurd\n\nMany people feel sometimes as though life is absurd. Thomas Nagel suggests this uncomfortable feeling is rooted by the fact that people inevitably take some things seriously in life, but that even the things they treat most seriously are at any moment open to their own incredible and inescapable human capacity to doubt. Nagel argues that when these two mutually unresolvable traits of seriousness and doubt collide, people become momentarily consumed by the feeling that life is absurd. Many manage to ignore this feeling and continue with their commitments through struggles with a sense of purpose and meaning in their lives. Albert Camus suggests that the human struggle to greater heights alone is enough to satisfy a person to feel meaning in life. Susan Wolf counters Camus’ argument stating that the struggle itself is not enough. Wolf believes that to find meaning in life, people must actively engage in projects that are objectively considered valuable. If Nagel and Wolf’s points are defensible, then to find the most meaning in life, one must actively engage in commitments that contain objective value least open to doubt, and in absence of the ability to make that distinction, one must choose the commitments they have the greatest passions to actively engage with. \n\nThomas Nagel raises the disturbing question of whether it is even possible to find meaning in a human life. He supports the idea that human life contains a sense of groundlessness but disagrees with the most common forms of reasoning for it. Many believe that this feeling of groundlessness is due to the fact that “what we do now won’t matter in a million years” or that, “we’re just too small in comparison with an infinite universe”. Others suggest that human life is meaningless because “we all die eventually” but even this idea does not seem to be rational as a possible cause for the feeling that life can sometimes seem absurd. More logically, Nagel argues that people feel on occasion that life is absurd when there is a “collision between the seriousness with which we take our lives and the perpetual possibility of regarding everything about which we are serious as arbitrary, or open to doubt.” (TA, 718) In other words, humans must inevitably be serious about some things, and yet we also have this inescapable capacity to doubt absolutely anything, including our most core beliefs and commitments which we treat with the utmost seriousness. Even the most ironic person in the world, for instance, must be serious about being ironic, and even the most seemingly certain observation such as, “the sky is blue”, could be theoretically doubted and considered an illusion or something of that nature. According to Nagel, it is the irreconcilability of these two inescapable human inherencies, seriousness and doubt, that gives people the occasional feeling that life is absurd.\n\nAlbert Camus considers the famous story of Sisyphus to be a metaphor for the human life, which he views as a repetition of struggles that has no ultimate resolve. He goes on to argue that “the struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart” and so “one must imagine Sisyphus happy” as he rolls a boulder up a hill for all of eternity. (TMOS, 123) Susan Wolf counters Camus’ position with a more demanding view. She argues that there are two interrelated criteria for a meaningful life. The first, a passionate attachment to some commitment or “active engagement” as she calls it, is satisfied by Sisyphus and his rock rolling. The second of Wolf’s criteria, however, deems Sisyphus’ rock rolling insufficient to provide meaning in his life. She argues that “meaningful lives are lives of active engagement in projects of worth” (EE, 458), defining worth as an objective consideration of value, independent of the individual’s preferences and enjoyments. While it is difficult to objectively make the distinction that some engagements are more valuable than others, such a process can be more easily accomplished in considering two extremes. \n\nConsider an example in which two thirty-year-old twin brothers have grown up very differently since a time when they both excelled incredibly in computer engineering during their first few years of college. From that point forward, one of the brothers committed nearly the entirety of his days to playing World of Warcraft on his computer. The other brother spent the decade after graduation inventing revolutionary software while working for a non-profit organization and improving technology on a global scale. The first brother wasted his talents and engagement on fantasy gameplay while the second actively engaged in a valuable career and maintained phenomenal relationships as he kept in touch regularly with family and friends. In this example, the second brother clearly pursued his natural tendencies and most valuable strengths to live his life actively engaged in projects of worth. Contrarily, his detached brother spent years absorbed in a fictional gameplay that addicted him so heavily that he failed to ever realize his playing of the game contained virtually no value outside of the game. Logically, it is safe to assume that most would objectively consider a career spent revolutionizing technology and maintaining close relationships to be more valuable than a devotion to World of Warcraft, and in this way, one could objectively make the distinction that the second brother experienced a more meaningful life. \n\nIn other instances, the distinction of objective value is not so simple to make, but rather impossible. In these cases, when the objective value of varying activities is more difficult to determine, one must choose to pursue the commitment they are most passionate about and thus most inclined to actively engage with. Consider a second hypothetical in which a college senior has a passion for writing and teaching others but also happens to excel in finance and business, though the latter is less engaging of an activity for him. In aiming to choose a career, the young man receives offers to work at three of the top banks, but has difficulty escaping his feeling of doubt that aside from the money, a career in business will only lead to a long career of boring work. He understands that he has the potential to be a phenomenal businessman but does not believe he could fully engage himself in the career and suspects he might end up simply going through the motions. He has no feasible route to begin a writing career but he contemplates the idea of writing on the side while pursuing a career in teaching because he is truly passionate about both writing and teaching. The task of objectively assigning more value to the writing and teaching option as opposed to the banking alternative is difficult, but the confidence that the young man has in his passion and ability to truly engage in writing and teaching gives that option the distinct advantage. This sense of certainty regarding one’s passion and ability to engage becomes the key to finding meaning in life when the values of opposing ways to move forward are objectively indistinguishable.\n\nThere may be no issue more central to the human life than the determination of how one can go about finding meaning within it. Nagel and Wolf provide a framework through which one can defend a system to guide decisions towards creating the most meaningful life possible. One must first consider, in the moment of any major decision, which option contains objective value that is least open to doubt. The second consideration must regard the level of one’s passion and capability of actively engaging in the relevant commitment or activity. Finally, the decision that will provide the most meaning for the individual’s life will be the one in which the objective value or personal passion is superior for one option in comparison to the other. In a world of uncertainty, one must strive to prioritize objective value and passion in an effort to choose the most meaningful path for a life, and pursue it with vigor. \n\nBibliography\n\nCamus, Albert. \"The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays, trans.

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Introducing: Coin of Jake ($JAKE)\n\nI have created a cryptocurrency. Naturally, it is called _Coin of Jake_. The currency's symbol is $JAKE.\n\n$JAKE is for me and the community I am building with your help through this blog, [my podcast](https://podofjake.com/), [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/blogofjake), and perhaps other means in the future.\n\nThe concept of creating a currency is quite novel, so I expect people will have a number of questions about what it is and how it works. I cannot answer all of them at this extremely early stage, but I can address a few things up front.\n\nJust as Bitcoin has a finite maximum supply of 21 million BTC, Coin of Jake has a finite maximum supply of 10 million $JAKE. That is to say, there will never be more than 10 million $JAKE in the world. It has a certain scarcity by definition, which tends to be a valuable intrinsic characteristic.\n\nWhile there is currently no means by which one can buy $JAKE, there are and will continue to be many opportunities to earn it. Because Twitter is better suited for the purpose of facilitating opportunities to make $JAKE at this point in time, the majority of these opportunities in the beginning will be offered by me [there](https://twitter.com/blogofjake).\n\nIn the near future, $JAKE will be listed on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), a decentralized exchange where people can go to buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies, soon including $JAKE. After it is listed, the market will determine the value of a $JAKE. In the beginning, I am thinking about $JAKEs like dollars but ones which I have a lot more of than actual dollars, enabling me to incentivize some value-creating earn opportunities among a number of other actions by people who want to make $JAKE. The tweet below was one of the very first examples of this from yesterday. If you read through the replies, the quality and quantity of them tells me that this was a great first step. One could learn a surprising amount simply by reading all of the responses to this tweet and the articles which people linked to along with them. Fundamentally, I do not think the responses would have been of nearly as high quality nor quantity without $JAKE, and so it is already creating value which would not otherwise exist.\n\nI have always been interested in discovering undiscovered talent. To some degree, some of my earliest supporters believe that I currently fit that description. My intentions with $JAKE are to reward these people for their early belief in and support of all that I am doing, and to use this currency to create value for those people, for the world at large, and for myself.\n\nSince this would be somewhat of an unprecedented accomplishment if done in the long-run, I of course cannot make any promises. I certainly do not want people to go buy a bunch of $JAKE and lose money which of course is always possible with any asset, especially one as speculative as this will be in the earliest days of its evolution. I want to be clear that I cannot guarantee that this will work by any means, but I sincerely believe that it will. I believe in myself, and although it will be as much up to all of you as it will be up to me, I will do my best to make $JAKE a success.\n\nThe link below will allow you to own a stake in $JAKE. Consider it a literal token of my appreciation, a small piece of equity in this community.\n\nhttps://app.tryroll.com/claim/JAKE-ki9TsQtePz5s (If you are reading this past a certain point in time, all $JAKE will already have been claimed via this link. [Email me](jake@blogofjake.com) or send me a [DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/blogofjake) and I will give you your first $JAKE.)\n\nYour first $JAKE is free to redeem and will be held in the wallet of the account that you will create on Roll. For those who are more familiar with crypto or plan to be in the future, $JAKE can be transferred off of Roll to any ETH Wallet as you please. For those who have already claimed their first $JAKE from my original [introduction on Twitter](https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1367865216776691718) or one of the opportunities to make $JAKE that has been offered thus far, you can still use the link above to add to your balance. Let's just say it pays to both follow me on Twitter and subscribe to my blog.\n\nAlready, well over 100 people own a stake in $JAKE. Soon there will be more than 1,000. I believe there is great potential in the possibilities for this growing community, and I am excited to see what happens. This is only just the beginning. As always, I appreciate your ongoing support.\n\n\\- Jake"}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Parables & Allegories\n\nWhat fine words these are, parables and allegories. I have only ever vaguely understood their definitions. \"Stories with greater meanings\" is how I thought of them, and that is not far off.\n\nHere are their definitions according to Merriam-Webster:\n\n  * _parable_ \\-- a usually short fictitious story that illustrates a moral attitude or a religious principle\n\n\n\n  *  _allegory_ \\-- the expression by means of symbolic fictional figures and actions of truths or generalizations about human existence; an instance (as in a story or painting) of such expression; a symbolic representation\n\n\n\n\nMy main takeaway from these definitions are that a parable is much more simply defined. Second to that, I suppose I take away that the two words can be differentiated by the realms that they signify. Parables seem to focus on morals and religion while allegories focus more broadly on truths and generalizations about human existence. In that way, it may be that all parables are allegories, but not all allegories are parables, like rectangles and squares.\n\nThe difference between parables and allegories came to my mind after discussing [Plato's ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave)_[Allegory of the Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave)_ with my friend Harry this weekend and proceeding last night to stumble upon a parable about a beggar in the opening chapter of Eckhart Tolle's book, _[The Power of Now](https://www.amazon.com/Unknown-The-Power-of-Now/dp/B00005AAPL/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=the+power+of+now&qid=1583940541&s=books&sr=1-2)_ , which I have just begun. That last sentence makes the things that I do sound a lot more good, smart, and wholesome than they actually are, but nonetheless, it is fully true.\n\nPlato's _Allegory of the Cave_ came up as Harry and I discussed the future of work in terms of things like millennial impatience (ourselves included) and whether the traditional 9 to 5 would survive. This reminded me of a perspective I really agreed with which I originally read in an [interview with Scott Birnbaum](https://www.alleywatch.com/2017/04/inside-the-mind-nyc-vc-scott-birnbaum-of-red-sea-ventures/), Founder of Red Sea Ventures. Here is what he said about millennials and the emerging generation of workers:\n\n_\"They’re optimizing for a life experience that aligns with their values and allows them to live the kind of life that they want to live. I think of it as Plato’s “The Allegory of the Cave.” It tells the story of people who are born in a cave, chained against a wall, and they see a game of shadows projected against the wall, and they think those shadows are people, their only reality. And then one day they’re unshackled and as they go out of the cave towards the light they realize everything they thought was reality was a lie. We’re in that moment in history. Where this emerging generation of workers are realizing that the game of shadows they saw their parents play into is not really the life they want to live and that there is something else out there. And that light at the end of the tunnel and that unshackling is the internet, which gave them access to information and a view into how other people are living their lives.\"_\n\nThe parable that I read last night in _The Power of Now_ went as follows:\n\n\"_A beggar had been sitting by the side of the road for over thirty years. One day a stranger walked by. \"Spare some change?\" mumbled the beggar, mechanically holding out his old baseball cap. \"I have nothing to give you,\" said the stranger. Then he asked: \"What's that you are sitting on?\" \"Nothing,\" replied the beggar. \"Just an old box. I have been sitting on it for as long as I can remember.\" \"Ever looked inside?\" asked the stranger. \"No,\" said the beggar. \"What's the point? There's nothing in there.\" \"Have a look inside,\" insisted the stranger. The beggar managed to pry open the lid. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was filled with gold._ \"\n\nThe author follows to say:\n\n\"_I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer: inside yourself._ \"\n\nI am not far enough into this book yet to make any sort of assessment but was intrigued by the introduction about how the author came to be \"enlightened\" as he claims he has been. He talks about how he was dealing with suicidal depression and how on one particularly bad morning as he felt a \"deep longing for annihilation, non-existence\", he kept thinking \"I cannot live with myself any longer\", before realizing how peculiar of a thought that was. He wondered for the first time if there was one or two of him, concluding based on his thought that he could not live with himself any longer that there must be two, the one who cannot live with himself, and \"himself\" that the \"one\" cannot live with. I believe the concept this refers to is important, that of separating awareness from thoughts of the mind, and this seems a solid introduction to that, regardless of what I end up thinking about this book.\n\nParables and allegories are very literally meaningful things. I am glad to have a better understanding of what they are today than I did yesterday. Hopefully, the same is now true for you too."}]}

It was about not counting down the days until weekends and vacations. This piece is the complement to that one. It is called  _Don’t dread the end._\n\nI have been away with my family this week in a northeast beach town where we have spent a week or two most summers since I was born. I noticed the other day that, unlike in years past, I am not so often thinking about how many days are left in the vacation. I used to do this all the time and feel like the week was going by so quickly. It was mostly a means of dreading the end. I do not think I need to explain in much detail the downside of dreading of the end. I will just say that any time spent dreading the end is not enjoyable, and if you are dreading what is after that time, you should probably be enjoying it while it lasts. \n\nI do not feel like I am dreading the end this time. It is not hard to understand why. \n\nLast year, I spent the day before we left on the beach, reading, swimming in the ocean, and enjoying time with my family under the sun. I spent the day after we left sitting in my cubicle in a dully lit office, working from 10 to 10, going home, going to sleep, waking up, and doing it again. \n\nThis year, I will again leave the beach and go back to work, but work now is what I choose it to be. I have two days of podcast recordings preceded by two days of prep. I will write. I will run. I will read. I will think. I may even work on my golf game. Some may call some of these things work. Others may not. I do not care what one calls them. The important part is that they are all things I care to do. \n\nI am not dreading the end of vacation this year because, as much as I am enjoying it, I am digging what I am doing outside of it as well. I know vacation would not be as special if it lasted longer so I am just enjoying it for what it is. It is what it is after all.\n\nRight now, I have reached a fine balance that, even while in it, I can appreciate is hard to reach and may be harder to maintain. It is the balance between counting down the days and dreading the end where I am definitively not doing either. I could even dread the end of having this balance itself. I could dread the day when I may find myself going for a job not because I want it but because doing something so different (not looking for work at 26) can sometimes feel harder than the common thing (having a job), even if the common thing requires 8 hours a day at a desk and the different thing allows me to do whatever I want whenever I want. I could dread that day and I could dread the end but why should I when I can simply let that thought pass as quickly as it came to mind? No counting down the days. No dread about the end.\n\nThis is one of my posts that reminds me I am writing for myself first and foremost. If I was writing for you, I might not be so positive. This might read phony to you, but I know it is true. I will be able to look back and read this and know that this balance is possible. I will know that I have been here before. I will know that I have lived in a state where, even if only for a short time, I have not counted the days, nor dreaded the end. I will know then that if I have done it once, I can do it again.\n\nWhen I wrote _Don't count the days_ , I quoted Muhammad Ali. He said, \"Don't count the days. Make the days count.\" I will end this piece with an attempt at a complement to that quote.\n\n\"Don't dread the end. Just end the dread.\""}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# My Morning Routine\n\nMy morning routine has changed a lot over the years. For most of my life, I did not have one at all. At least, nothing conscious or intentional beyond showering, getting dressed, and having breakfast before school. Even the shower and breakfast parts became optional in college, especially before the days when I had an early morning statistics class.\n\nThings changed when I started working full-time in San Francisco during the summer of 2017. I became more conscious and intentional about my morning routine. I have still had many months since then without any morning routine, and I typically do not practice the same routine on weekends, but for the majority of the time over the last two and a half years, I have had at least one morning practice beyond general human hygiene that in my book qualifies as a morning routine. Below is the morning routine that I am beginning with in 2020:\n\n1\\. Wake up, get out of bed, turn off phone alarm across the room\n\n2\\. Breathing exercise (4/7/8 second inhale/hold/exhale x 10 reps)\n\n3\\. Chug a large bottle of water\n\n4\\. Shower and brush teeth\n\n5\\. Back stretches (5 minutes)\n\n6\\. Journal (1 page or 2-3 minutes, be overly positive and grateful)\n\n7\\. Vitamin Drink\n\n8\\. Blog\n\n9\\. Breakfast (Green Smoothie)\n\nThis whole routine (excluding the blog) should not take any longer than about 30 minutes without distraction. The blog can take longer than everything else combined depending on the post and so for that reason some days I will skip it to write later in the day. Everything else is relatively quick and easy and I believe each item adds to the sum of a great way to start the day.\n\nThis is the most extensive morning routine I have tried in terms of the number of items, and it includes most of the individual morning practices that I have tried to date. Others that I have tried include cold showers in the summer, meditation, working out / running, and walking (usually to work as the last step of the routine). The 2 or 3 minute positivity / gratitude journal has been the stickiest practice for me and while I have taken multi-month breaks I have probably journaled on about 75% of weekdays over the last two and half years. In future posts, I will likely explain my rationale for the inclusion of some of these practices above, and describe them in greater detail to the extent that may be helpful as well. I have found that a key to maintaining the routine is to not beat myself up when I miss days, and to give myself periods of time without any routine at all. I encourage you to follow the simple mantra I got from a venture capitalist named Brad Feld who I was fortunate to connect with several months ago through one of my cold emails. When you miss a day or lose the habit of your routine, “Simply begin again.”"}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Publishing Channels\n\n“Create what you want and let people get it where they go.”\n\nThat’s something I’ve been telling myself lately. So what exactly does that mean?\n\nWell, the second part “let people get it where they go” is similar to the common advice to “meet customers where they are.” Meeting customers where they are is about appealing to them in the places where they are already spending their time online, though it applies offline in the physical world as well. You’re not trying to get them to go to a new place. You’re simply meeting them where they are. I’m aligned with this strategy, mostly.\n\nBut if you change the word “customers” to “people”, the saying “meet _people_ where they are” is understood to have a different meaning. Meeting people where they are is about compromise. It’s not about meeting people where they are in a literal sense in terms of the digital place or website or channel where they already spend some time. It’s about meeting them where they are in terms of their tastes and preferences and desires. This, I am not aligned with.\n\nThat’s where the first part of my first sentence comes in — “create what you want”. That’s what I want to do — to create what I want. That might seem obvious, that I want to do what I want. But a lot of people actually don’t do what they want. Why not? Because they prioritize their want to do what the customer wants. They want to meet people where they are. I want to create what I want and let people get it where they go. There’s a difference. It seems like a nuanced difference, but it’s not. It changes everything you do because you are doing it unapologetically for you, not for some customer, imaginary or otherwise.\n\nThis difference in approaches changes both what you do and how you do it. That makes sense because it all stems from this fundamental difference in why you’re doing it — for you, because it’s what you want to do. For me, I like blogging and podcasting, to a lesser degree tweeting, and more recently have been making some digital art. With all of these things, I do what I want. I write about whatever I want. I don’t restrain myself to a particular subject or niche that I recognize could more effectively build an audience. The same is true for podcasting — no niche. I just talk to whoever I want about whatever I want. I also produce the podcast the way that I want. That means minimal editing, post-production, marketing, and all that. I tweet what I want and I make the digital art that I want. And I do all of this pseudonymously, even though I know I would probably have a larger following if I showed my face and shared my name. Both build trust and likability, but pseudonymity is my preferred approach for operating on the internet. So that’s the general overview on what I do and how I do it. Now how about where I share it?\n\nFor a long time, I posted my blogs on a Wordpress website, my podcasts on Apple and Spotify, and I tweeted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0FJAKE), as one does. More recently, I’ve made an effort to meet people where they are practically, but not preferentially — to “let people get it where they go” but not to “meet people where they are”, if you can recall the difference as I described it. Logistically, this means I am sharing my blogs, podcasts, tweets, and digital art on multiple platforms, which is normal in some contexts, but unusual in others. For example, it is normal to publish podcasts across [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pod-of-jake/id1525087226), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ov7VtfvkAq5OCpW61ATwm), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@PODOFJAKE), and more, and I publish mine there as well as [elsewhere](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/pod-of-jake/) and on my [podcast website](https://podofjake.com/). It is less usual to publish blogs in multiple places, but that is what I have started to do in an effort to let people read my writing wherever they go, wherever they are, wherever they like. \n\nFor years, I resisted moving from my Wordpress website to Substack because I felt Substack was for newsletters and what I write is not a newsletter. But this stubbornness, while grounded in fact, was preventing people from being able to serendipitously stumble upon my writing, as the internet is inclined to enable. Substacks are much more easily discoverable than Wordpress websites because people who like to read people’s writing are already on Substack where Wordpress does not have a comparable network effect. So I switched to [Substack](https://www.blogofjake.com/p/how-to-get-lucky) earlier this year, but not to Substack only. Now, when I write, I publish on Substack and [Paragraph](https://paragraph.xyz/@jake/impressively-you), a Substack-like website for people interested in crypto and web3. On Substack, supporters can choose to do a paid subscription to support my work (though everything I write is available to free subscribers all the same). On Paragraph, supporters can collect my blog posts by minting them onchain (for crypto people). They can do that for free except for the platform fee of .000777 ETH (~$2.71). A little less than half of that goes to me. In addition to Substack and Paragraph, I sometimes take a screenshot of the full blog post and publish it on Twitter and/or Warpcast as a [“screenshot essay”](https://warpcast.com/jake/0xc6727366). I’ll also share the Paragraph post on Warpcast as what I call an [“inframe onchain essay”](https://warpcast.com/jake/0x8d005ae2) or “IOE” (don’t worry if you have no idea what I’m talking about here). For those who don't know Warpcast, it is roughly a Twitter-like social network for crypto people with crypto elements involved. I generally try to cross-post my tweets there as casts and vice versa, except for when the content of the tweet or cast is less relevant on the other platform, which has increasingly become the case for some of the more crypto-native content I have been posting on [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/jake).\n\nLastly, I am starting to make more of an effort to publish all of my content onchain — blogs, podcasts, art, or otherwise. I am posting my podcasts on [pods.media](https://pods.media/dashboard/pod-of-jake) where people can mint them just like my blog posts on Paragraph (for free with the small fee of which a share goes to me). In addition to posting my blogs on Paragraph, which puts them onchain, I am planning to start publishing those blogs as [screenshot essays onchain via Zora](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x7412e0e6bafb48a48d21f0adf5fefedf2e8672ea/1), the same place I am publishing my [digital art](https://zora.co/collect/base:0x7a5fff8a9e392af3a6bfcaeba92e22f626f0409b/4), for people who might prefer that to the Paragraph posts, or stumble upon it on Zora where they might not otherwise have found it on Paragraph.\n\nSo why am I doing all of this? It’s more useful to start with the opposite question — why not? The main reasons why I would not to do this would be if it added a material amount of time to my processes — especially if it added so much logistical work that it discouraged me from doing the actual thing — writing, podcasting, etc.. But the fact is it doesn’t. So long as I setup a system where I can pop open a folder of bookmarks titled “Publish Blog” or “Publish Podcast”, it’s just copying and pasting across a few different websites and filling in some simple information fields that are pretty much the same across all of them. For tweeting and casting, it’s as simple as copying and pasting a tweet from Twitter and casting it on Warpcast or vice versa. There are even some apps that can be used to do this automatically, in one click, though I’m not using them because it hasn’t made sense for me to cross-post in every case, and the manual approach has emerged for me organically and been easy enough. The other reason not to do this would be if it in any way compromised my work — that is, what I do or how or why I do it — but, again, it doesn’t. I’m not meeting people where they are. I’m creating what I want and letting people get it where they go.\n\nIn closing, if you want to follow some of my work, and you don’t know where to start because of all of the different channels I’ve mentioned, don’t worry about it. The whole point is that I am going to do what I do and you can just continue to do what you do and, if I’m doing it right, you’ll see me there. Just look for the blue dot."}]}

It's the same for me. If you are lucky, some people do care about you. But none of them think about you as much as you think about you. A few of them may think about you a lot. And a few of them may care about you a lot. One, two, or a few might even be willing to sacrifice their life for you. But again, you are lucky to have a few.\n\nMeanwhile, you are you. All the time. You think about you. Not all the time, but a lot. You can never get away from you. You are naturally biased by your own point of view. You think people think about you because you think about you because you are you, but no one really cares.\n\nNow, let me be clear. \"Nobody cares\" is not meant to be taken literally. Nor is it meant to be taken negatively. For me, it is a useful hyperbole. It reminds me I'm free.\n\nHere is how the logic goes:\n\nNobody cares what I write.

Between us and the Syrian border was about a football field of land. On the majority of the field, from about the 20 to the 20 yard line using that same football reference, a few dozen cows grazed. The red zones had yellow flags to show that those areas were filled with land mines.\n\nOn the way home, we drove along the Jordanian border and after dinner we had a journalist come in and talk with us about geopolitics in the Middle East. Israel’s border issues are seemingly endless in their complexities but today’s lecture helped to give me an extremely rudimentary understanding of what is going on at the north border with Hezbollah and its military stronghold in Lebanon, to the northeast with the civil war drawing global attention in Syria, and with the Gaza Strip in the lower left corner of Israel where the Hamas so regularly shoot rockets and drops fires via kites over Israel’s border that it is referred to as a cyclical occurrence. There is also the Israeli-Palestinian conflict taking root on the West Bank (of Jordan) in eastern Israel. I will not go deeper into any of these subjects because my understanding of them is far less than my available time to write today, which is also very little.\n\nStill, I look forward to learning more and discussing with people who know a lot more about these subjects than I do."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Positive Thinking, Positive Teaching\n\nGenerally, I have a positive view when it comes to positivity.\n\nI believe it is beneficial to maintain a positive perspective. I trace the origination of my own persistently positive thinking back to the beginning of my first gap year when, coming off of a miserable freshman year of college, I had taken the plunge into the unknown. I think I recognized that a year on my own while my friends were all in school could get pretty depressing so I instinctually ignored considering negative thoughts as an option. You can't fall into a downwards spiral if you never let yourself peak over the edge. I chose to be positive and I never looked down or back.\n\nPositive thinking is a prerequisite for positive teaching, which I have come to believe is an effective method as a result of my own experiences reflected back at me by two of the best teachers of all-time in their respective sports, Harvey Penick in golf and Bill Walsh in football.\n\nI am currently reading Bill Walsh's book, _The Score Takes Care of Itself_. Earlier this year, I read _Harvey Penick's Little Red Book_. When two legendary teachers in their respective games give advice that sounds as similar as what is to follow, it must either be really coincidental or really right. My money in this case is on the latter.\n\nIn his chapter titled, \"Positive Thinking\", Harvey Penick says, \"When I am teaching, I never say never and I don't say don't, if I can help it.\" He follows, \"I try to put everything in positive, constructive terms.\" Harvey explains, \"when you are hitting a golf shot, a negative thought is pure poison.\" He doesn't even like the phrase \"give yourself the benefit of the doubt\" because it \"has the dangerous word 'doubt' in it\".\n\nBill Walsh says similarly, \"Be positive. I spent far more time teaching what to do than what not to do; far more time teaching and encouraging individuals than criticizing them; more time building up than tearing down.\" In his chapter titled \"The Leverage of Language\" he writes, \"You demonstrate a lack of assuredness when you talk constantly in negatives. When attempting to help someone attain the next level of performance, a supportive approach works better than a constantly negative or downside-focused approach.\"\n\nOf course, teachers must not ignore negative actions or habits that must be corrected. Both Harvey and Bill share plenty of wisdom on how best to deliver constructive criticism, but the great majority of their teaching is in positive terms. Positive teaching comes from positive thinking and positive thinking comes from positive teaching. Add some positivity to the way you think, the way you talk, and the way you teach. The impact will be positive."}]}

Since then, Amazon shares are up over 27% versus the S&P 500 which is up just over 6%. I stand by everything that I wrote in that post and encourage you to read it again. The fact that the investment has done well in this short period of time does not matter as much as the added conviction I continue to gain in my logic and general perspective as an investor.\n\nIn that same post, I quoted a previous one from February 27th. That was my first post on the _[Coronavirus](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/27/coronavirus/)_. In it, I wrote that I had sold all of my stocks on February 24th (the Monday prior).

At the same time, if I can continue to develop a keen understanding of the world around me in a way that enables me to make good predictions and give good advice, many posts will age nicely.

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# How not to spend half of my life on my screens\n\nAccording to the _Screen Time_ feature, I have spent an average of 2-3 hours on my iPhone and 4-5 hours on my iPad every day during the month of May. In total, that is 6-8 hours of screen time every day between those two devices. I have not been using my computer much except for writing so I am not concerned with including that Screen Time for now. What I am concerned about is that I am spending almost or exactly half of my waking hours (16) on these stupid smart devices. On my deathbed, I cannot imagine looking back and being glad that I spent almost half of my twenties on an iSomething screen. The very fact that such a time suck is possible is why I consider the iPhone and iPad to be so [addictive](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/03/painkillers-coffee-and-the-concept-of-withdrawal-reversal/). It is why I [set my iPhone to greyscale](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/05/consider-the-colorless-iphone/). I often notice when I am feeling unusually down or stressed for no reason that it is correlated with my screen time (iPhone worse than iPad worse than computer). Last night I decided it is time to make a change.\n\nI took some time to write down most of what I do on my iPhone and iPad versus what I want to do on them. In other words, I wrote down my current use versus ideal use and then designed a path to implement the desired change. I have been spending most of my screen time on Twitter, Safari, Messages, and Superhuman (email), with a lesser amount of time on a handful of other apps as well. On Safari, I am often keeping both literal and figurative tabs on stock prices and news and Coinbase to keep an eye on my cryptocurrencies. I have fallen into an old habit of bouncing around between sites like ESPN, CNN, CNBC, and my old friend Yahoo. It feels ridiculous to be finding myself on ESPN so often when there are literally no sports on these days. Nonetheless, let me briefly explain the initial solution that I have designed.\n\niPhone - I put the Podcasts, RunKeeper, Notes, and Clock apps in the bottom bar. I will aim not to use my phone for any app outside of that bottom bar except for once or twice a day during designated screen time. I have yet to specify what that will be but it should not end up being longer than 30 minutes or an hour in total. I moved Twitter and Safari off of the first page to be less tempting. From previous changes to my phone, my notifications are off for practically everything, the colors are set to greyscale, and the screen is relatively uncluttered. You can see screenshots of my first and second screens on my iPhone below (note: screenshots on greyscale still show the colors).\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac3d9f5b-8cdf-462d-9e35-1c6b9b27e345_576x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac3d9f5b-8cdf-462d-9e35-1c6b9b27e345_576x1024.png)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94281df1-a925-49cb-93d7-794edc7bc6db_576x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94281df1-a925-49cb-93d7-794edc7bc6db_576x1024.png)\n\niPad - Same thing, different apps. I put the the Books, Spotify, Notes, and Calendar apps in the bottom bar. The objective is to limit all use outside of reading and music. Again, I moved Twitter and Safari to the second page. I do not have my iPad on greyscale because it feels almost criminal to rob the beauty from such an aesthetically pleasing machine, but perhaps I will consider it. Same rules apply. I will aim only to operate outside of the bottom bar apps during designated iPhone/iPad time. The 30 minutes to an hour that I referenced above includes both devices and most of that should be spent on the iPad because it is better in every way unless I am on the go. You can see a screenshot of my iPad below. You might recognize [the background](https://blogofjake.com/2020/05/01/pale-blue-dot/).\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa02f05f-bbbf-4144-bcc1-c2b7516bb0b9_768x1024.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa02f05f-bbbf-4144-bcc1-c2b7516bb0b9_768x1024.jpeg)\n\nI do not want to spend one half or even close to one quarter of my waking days texting or on Twitter or the internet or habitually checking Instagram, Snapchat, GroupMe, stock prices, Coinbase, CNBC, ESPN, CNN, and Yahoo. Who cares about any of that? It is all junk food for the mind. When I get rid of it, I expect to notice that real food will start to taste better again. The natural sugars of an apple. The natural joys of reading a good book, writing with pen and paper, or simply being outside.\n\nMaybe this is the change that will finally move me to call my friends more. That should be allowed outside of screen time as well. There is a reason we spend so much time on these devices. They are amazing, in moderation. Too much of most anything is a bad thing and several hours on these devices feels like far too much. I am excited to make this change and see it how it goes. I am excited to see what my days will be like with several more hours in them. Even if I were to literally sit and do nothing, I have long believed it is better to do nothing than to do nothing on one's phone. Let the experiment begin."}]}

After much time guessing who it would be, Lauren’s friend hoping it would be Billie Eilish (Finneas’ better known sister), her friend’s boyfriend and I hoping it would be someone from the Super Bowl last night, Elon Musk, or Margot Robbie (who is on the schedule for tomorrow), and Lauren hoping it was going to be Brad Pitt after Jimmy showed a pre-recorded bit that they did for the show, the surprise guest was revealed to be none other than RuPaul, who is not only the most famous drag queen in the world, but as he/she corrected Jimmy on the show, “the queen of drag”. So much for Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThe top three moments for me were the beginning monologue, Andy Samburg’s buddy from The Lonely Island eating a raw T Bone steak a few seats to the left of us as part of an act, and Jimmy walking through the crowd to do some unrecorded Q&A during one of the breaks. The Roots were on point as expected beginning with _Express Yourself_ and the performance from Finneas (as well as his interview for that matter) surprised in a good way. I am going to check out some more of his music this week.\n\nI was most surprised by the number of lights, the largeness of the cameras, and the hidden door in the waffle wall behind the couch area through which Jimmy would exit the stage between segments.\n\nI used to watch the show quite a bit when Jimmy first took it over from David Letterman but other than that I have never been much of a late night talk show guy, or any time or type of talk show guy really. Nonetheless, being a part of the audience was a thrill and an experience that I would highly recommend entering yourself in the lottery to win if you are near the New York City area.\n\nI have been a fan of Jimmy’s since the movie _Fever Pitch_ , the underrated romantic comedy that took an unscripted turn when the Red Sox ended up breaking the curse and winning The World Series that year. I remember I happened to visit Boston for a Sox game with my dad that summer and there was fake snow in the streets in August for the purpose of the film.\n\nWe all really enjoyed the show and Jimmy certainly does a great job hosting it. If you happen to watch it tonight, you might see us a couple of rows back in the middle. I was in a grey sweater, probably clapping and trying to figure out which camera to look at."}]}

McConaughey talks about the reasons he started keeping a diary, a practice that he views as a positive one and one which has persisted in his life for decades. I realized then that, while I have written about things as inconsequential as [the correct way to eat nigiri](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/13/how-to-eat-nigiri/), I have never written explicitly about why I write a double-spaced page in a journal every weekday morning and have done so for the majority of the last few years since I graduated college.\n\nThe purpose is pretty simple really. I believe that in starting my day by putting positive words to paper, my perspective throughout the day becomes that much more positive. My journaling practice is intentionally short and sweet. Some say the best workout is the one you will do everyday. I believe the same is as true with most habits. My morning journal takes me between two and a few minutes and consists of filling 15 lines (each with an empty line in between) in a [5 by 8 Moleskine](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8867320513/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), plus usually one more line in the bottom margin as I always have something more to be grateful for by the time I get to the bottom.\n\nIn terms of logistics, I always top the page with the date written out like, \"October 27, 2020\". In the top right corner, as of this year, I have started writing the number of the day of my life. This gets tricky sometimes after not writing over weekends or missing a day here and again but I believe today is my 9,623rd day (I just write \"9623\"). As a matter of fact, I just double checked that [here](https://www.calculator.net/age-calculator.html) for the first time since I started and it's still exactly right. I suppose the math is actually not that hard...\n\nThe average life expectancy for a man in the USA is roughly 30,000 days. Perhaps because our ages in years carry with them certain associations of what it means to be in one's twenties or forties or sixties, I find that the day count puts the length of one's life into better perspective. It becomes clear in writing that I am on my 9,623rd day that I am a third through the average life, and though I am optimistic that [healthspans](https://blogofjake.com/2020/07/02/how-to-live-longer-and-healthier/) are poised to increase substantially in the coming decades, I also believe in the benefits of keeping one's mortality in mind. The best way to live today is to remember that you could die tomorrow. In the words of the Ancient Romans, \"Memento mori.\" In the words of Don Draper, \"I'm living like there's no tomorrow, because there isn't one.\" In the words of Steve Jobs:\n\n> “Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.  \n>   \n> Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.   \n>   \n> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.   \n>   \n> No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.”\n> \n> Steve Jobs\n\nOnce I date and day my journal, I always start it almost the same. \"Today is going to be a _____ day.\" The word above the line can change but I would be hard-pressed to go through my hundreds or thousands of entries and find a word any less positive than \"good\". After that first line, I fill the rest of the page with positive thoughts, expressions of gratitude, hopes and intentions for the day, thanks for the highlights of yesterday, and whatever else comes to mind. Not every sentence is always positive but most are and almost none are negative though they may be neutral. Rarely do I take the pen off the paper in between the first sentence and the last. This forces a stream of positive consciousness.\n\nSometimes, I write things that are not necessarily true in an effort to make them true. For instance, if my back hurts, I might write, \"my back feels good today\". If it actually feels good, I would probably write that it feels great. Pain is in large part mental anyway. When it comes to my journal, negatives become positives and positives are pushed as far as possible. There may be something to be said for a journal that spends more time writing about struggles and such but if someone were to look back and read all of my journals they would not find any of that. When it comes to my morning journal, I write like I am the luckiest man in the world. The more I write it, the more it seems to be true.\n\nI will end this post the way I often start my morning journal. Today is going to be a great day."}]}

That is like saving 6 trees or over 200 square feet of Arctic ice every year.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with the terminology, that is okay. I was like you not too long ago. A person’s carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide produced directly or indirectly in support of the life that person leads. When a person has a carbon footprint of zero, that means they are carbon neutral. In other words, it means that their impact on Earth’s atmosphere is zero. It is neutral.\n\nIt took me a few years to get my carbon footprint down to 7 tons per year in the first place. It used to be closer to the American average of 19.5. We are lucky that what is good for Earth is often good for us too. I started doing things that were good for Earth and good for me, mostly because they were good for me. I did not know much about the climate crisis back then.\n\nI walked to work. I kept my electric bill down. I tried to buy things less often and more locally. I lived in [minimalist ](https://blogofjake.com/2020/04/17/minimalism/)apartments in San Francisco and New York. I even started [eating vegan ](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/21/the-gluten-free-vegan-diet-intermittent-fasting-and-green-smoothies/)during the week. These choices made me healthier and happier while lowering my carbon footprint. Still, they did not make me carbon neutral. I did not think that was possible.\n\nThen I found [Wren](https://projectwren.com/).\n\nWren made it look easy to go carbon neutral. It quickly turned out to be even easier than it looked.\n\nWren helped me calculate my carbon footprint with some simple questions. Then it showed me how much I could contribute on a monthly basis to any of a few trustworthy projects that would offset my carbon footprint to zero. I chose to support a [community tree planting project](https://projectwren.com/projects/community-tree-planting) in East Africa. Like all the other things that are good for Earth and good for us, the tree planting project is good for Earth and good for the people involved. I committed less than $6 per month. That was the moment I became carbon neutral.\n\nSome people say the climate crisis is too large a problem for any individual to make a difference. Those people must not have read about The Civil Rights Movement. They must have missed the #MeToo Movement too. They must not know Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old environmental activist from Sweden who stood up to the leaders of the world and last year became the youngest ever  _Time Person of the Year_.\n\nWe cannot all be the next Greta Thunberg, but we can all join the global movement to end the climate crisis. We can all do things that are better for Earth and better for us. We can all become climate neutral as individuals, and then as humanity. We can all help save Earth.\n\nI recommend going to [projectwren.com](https://projectwren.com/) to get started."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Investing in Trust and Access through Trust and Access\n\nIn no particular order, I consider Union Square Ventures, Andreesson Horowitz, and Sequioa Capital to be three of the very best venture firms in the world. I have read writing from each of them. I have followed a number of their investments. I have listened to many of their partners speak on podcasts. As a result, I have come to value their perspectives and trust their judgements. While I appreciate that some of their individual investments will fail, I believe that their portfolios overall will continue to be extremely successful.\n\nWhen two or three of these top VCs share an investment in common, that gives me as much confidence as I could have in a company without knowing anything about it. I can then learn about the company myself in order to evaluate it from my own perspective. This is where one of my core beliefs becomes extremely important. My belief is that \"I don't know much, but at least I know that\". Knowing that I do not know much allows me to let the positive evaluations of the ultra- smart and successful venture capitalists I have come to trust carry even more weight than my own perspective. Instead of relying on my judgement about a particular asset, I can rely on my judgement of other people's judgement. I have much more conviction in that than I do in my ability to effectively evaluate a crypto-powered VPN, especially without having had the opportunity to meet the team.\n\nThat is what Orchid is. Orchid is a crypto-powered VPN. As of this past weekend, Orchid is also my largest crypto investment besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. I do not have nearly as much money in Orchid as I do in the other two for a number of reasons, but there are two big reasons why I have invested as much in it as I have. It comes down to trust and access.\n\nSequoia and Andreesson Horowitz are invested in Orchid. Sequoia, Andreesson Horowitz, and USV are all invested in a crypto investment firm called Polychain Capital. Polychain Capital is invested in Orchid too. Sequoia and USV are invested in another crypto investment firm called MetaStable Capital. MetaStable Capital was founded by Naval Ravikant whose individual investing perspective I trust similarly to many of the top partners at these top VC firms. MetaStable Capital is invested in Orchid as well. This is where I get my conviction in my investment. I understand from a very rudimentary perspective why a crypto-powered VPN could be powerful, but my conviction is not so much in the product as it is in the people who have earned my trust. My conviction is in my judgement in determining who to trust. Ultimately, it all comes down to trusting my judgment itself.\n\nWhen it comes to investing, however, trust is not the only thing that matters. Another thing that matters, unfortunately, is access. All people cannot access the same investment opportunities. Most people know Zoom by now. Most of us with access to an investing platform like Charles Schwab or Robinhood could investment in Zoom if we wanted to. We could not have invested in Zoom three years ago. It was not a public company yet. VCs like Sequoia could, and they did so at a much lower valuation than the average person ever had the opportunity to. When it comes to assets that are appreciating in value, investing earlier is better. Few people outside of investment firms and accredited investors have access to those early investments. It is a great opportunity when we do.\n\nMy access to investing in crypto comes through having a computer, internet access, and a Coinbase account. Coinbase is an exchange on which 20 different crypto assets can be traded. USV, Andreeson Horowitz, and Polychain Capital have all invested in Coinbase. I trust it for those reasons. I have also developed some level of trust in its CEO Brian Armstrong and former CTO Balaji Srinivasan. I have enjoyed Coinbase as a user and I have come to trust it to a high degree. I trust that Coinbase as an organization in aggregate knows more about the world of crypto assets than I do, many degrees of magnitude more. I trust that the crypto assets they offer on their exchange are at least not scams and at the most some of the best 20 investments out of the thousands of crypto assets that exist. Of course, just like the VCs I trust the most, I do not expect Coinbase to be perfect in all of its picks, but rather exceptional overall.\n\nBesides Bitcoin and Ethereum, I have more conviction in my investment in Orchid than in any other crypto asset. I was able to develop that conviction through trust. Conveniently, Orchid is also by far the smallest crypto asset that I have access to invest in through Coinbase. For good investments, smallness is equivalent to earliness. With that earliness comes more risk, but also multitudes more upside.\n\nTrust and access are core to what makes Bitcoin and Orchid so cool and revolutionary. They allow us to trust in peer-to-peer networks instead of institutions. In doing so, they compromise the power of those institutions and return control to the individuals themselves in many ways, including access.\n\nAnd so, it is only fitting that trust and access have become critical parts of my thesis for investing, essentially, in trust and access.\n\n_Note: If you would like to create an account to invest in[Coinbase ](https://www.coinbase.com/join/aronwa_0)or learn more about [Orchid](https://coinbase.com/earn/oxt/invite/s5w3704y), you can follow through the links in the text of this sentence. I would receive minimal crypto rewards no different than the ones you would receive if you were to later share your links in the same way._"}]}

It will make some people happy. For me it is the latter.\n\nHis previous album, _Swimming_ , was a long departure from \"Easy Mac with the cheesy raps\", the high school kid whose 2010 song, _Nikes on My Feet_ , would have me listening to his music for the next decade. _Swimming_ may have hardly been a rap album, but it was easily my favorite Mac album.\n\nNow, _Circles_ closes the loop. It ventures even further away from a traditional rap album, but I have always enjoyed all of Mac's music, even that of his jazzy alter ego, Larry Lovestein. I have listened to _Circles_ only once through this morning, but I like it. I appreciate its existence, even after his. My favorite songs on my first listen were _Everybody_ , _That's On Me_ , and _Surf_ , in the order that they appear. Still, I will likely listen to _Circles_ mostly in its entirety as an album, just like I did with _Swimming_.\n\nI hope you will give it a listen.\n\nFor those who do not know, Mac died at 26 from an accidental drug overdose, a combination of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol. It is a story that is far too common these days. Rest in Peace, Mac.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/5sY6UIQ32GqwMLAfSNEaXb?si=RjZe-JsgQraGKvuG0No2OA"}]}

Currently, I am still using an iPhone 7. I did buy the original Apple Watch only a few months after its release (April 2015), but the only Apple products that I have ever pre-ordered or bought immediately on release have been the Airpods (December 2016) and, more recently, the Airpods Pro (October 2019). I have really enjoyed both versions of Apple’s take on the wireless headphones, but many people view these products as more than meets the eye (resisted the temptation to write “meets the ear”).\n\nI have heard a number of people whose opinions I value predict that the impact of the Airpods will be the most significant of any Apple product since the iPhone. In most cases, the basis of these perspectives relies on a forecast of the future that involves some combination of technological advancement of natural language processing and translation, the improved design, interface, and utilization of voice-activated virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, the emergence of new voice-activated and audio-based applications, the proliferation of voice and audio enabled technology users and growth of overall engagement around the world, and the increase in the supply of audio content that will rise to meet that future demand.\n\nI do not have much insight into the rate of improvement of these technologies though I know some believe that they are at a tipping point. I imagine that is part of what is driving some of the excitement. Nonetheless, while I do not have much of any idea when this future will unfold in some unpredictable form that may look and sound a lot like or unlike what people are predicting, I do believe that people will be talking to technology more and listening to a greater proportion of non-music audio year over year for the next several years, if not the next several after that as well. I also predict that I personally will listen to more non-music audio and do more things through Siri and Alexa in 2020 than I have in all of my past years combined. For now, that is not too high of a threshold to overcome."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# 40-Hour Fast\n\nAs I write this, I am about 36 hours into my first ever 40-hour fast. I cannot give you a specific reason why I decided to do it. I suppose I realized that I was fasting around 20 hours most days last week somewhat by accident (~16 hours from dinner to lunch is more the standard for me during the week) and I figured I could double that fast without too much difficulty. There is something to be said for going longer or further than you have ever gone before -- whether it be running, walking, fasting or meditating. My longs are a marathon, not sure, 40 hours (soon), and 1 hour respectively, so the second, third, and fourth are all very breakable in the near-term. As for the first, I don't know that I will be running another [marathon](https://blogofjake.com/2020/06/24/26/) this year, but I would not put it past myself either.\n\nAnyway, the idea of week-long fasts and meditation retreats have long intrigued me but I have not yet gone for either. This 40-hour fast seemed like an \"easy\" first step. It would break my arbitrary boundary of never having fasted for longer than a day. The hardest part for me was around dinnertime last night but it was not so bad at all and I'm hardly even hungry this morning. I know I could go longer but I believe it is important sometimes to stop when you still have more in the tank. That way, when I go to do a longer fast eventually, I will remember this one as having been relatively easy and can go back and read here that I knew I could go longer at the time.\n\nFor those interested in fasting, here is my introduction to fasting in a[ tweet](https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1366037093236015105?s=20):\n\nFor the 40-hour fast, I employed a few more elements. First, I [got a group together](https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1365070749967466499?s=20), just from the people who follow me on Twitter, and the few of us have helped each other over the last few dozen hours with a message here and there. Nothing annoying, just enough to know we are all in it together, an underrated force in any endeavor. My dad ended up joining our merry band of fasters as well, though he stayed out of the groupchat.\n\nThe second thing I did was to take any and all pressure off of myself to do anything other than the fast yesterday. I made it the only thing I needed to do. This was especially easy because the only thing I needed to do was to not do something (eat). Complete inaction would have sufficed. I am fortunate to be in a position where I have enough freedom and control over my time to be able to make that my singular priority for a day. Usually, I have a thing or two I want to get done in a day, but yesterday it was no pressure. Of course, I ended up doing some things anyway and actually had a reasonably productive day, but I made it feel more like a Sunday and less like a Monday. You want to do yourself as many favors as you can when you have something challenging to do. In other words, \"make it easy\". I believe this was the term used in James Clear's book _Atomic Habits_ which reinforced a lot of things I knew and didn't know I knew about habits and also taught me some new things in a much clearer framework than I had ever thought up on my own. Clear is his last name after all.\n\nThe last thing I am going to do is to eat whatever I want once I can in a few hours. This was also noted in Clear's book. You want to give yourself a reward after the thing you want to encourage yourself to do more of. I would like to do more long fasts in the future, and while it may not be as much of a habit as the 16+ hour fasts I tend to do during the week, I want to reflect on my longest fast to date as a positive experience. Last night, I was thinking I would treat myself to an afternoon pizza (not something I would usually eat in the middle of the day on a weekday), but this morning I am realizing almost any food will do. I imagine the sheer phenomenon of taste will be a reward in and of itself. I am not starving, but I am excited to eat.\n\nI think it is good to occasionally remind ourselves of the difference between wants and [needs](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/31/the-eleven-human-needs/#:~:text=For%20the%20time%20being%2C%20I,healing%2C%20learning%2C%20and%20meaning.&text=That%20is%20why%20we%20need%20both%20calories%20and%20nutrients.) in this world of consistent indulgence where we so often confuse the former for the latter. Just like how when you are sick, the only thing you want is to feel better, when you are fasting for long enough, the only thing you want is to eat. It is good to summon this singular focus once in a while. As much as I try to be appreciative, I inevitably take so much for granted. Deprive yourself of food for a day and you will have no choice but to gain some appreciation for the little things."}]}

The Democratic National Convention begins on August 17th and only two candidates in modern history have waited until then to announce their running mate.\n\nBiden’s VP selection has been the largest (and essentially the only) story receiving constant attention related to his campaign for President over the last few months. It has been followed closely only by the narrative that he has lost his marbles which has flared up once again following his regrettable comments about African Americans the other day. One could even speculate that the first storyline has been dragged out by Biden’s campaign intentionally in order to prevent the second from receiving more attention than it already is.\n\nThese top two storylines are fundamentally about indecision and a lack of fitness to serve as President, respectively. These are not good themes for someone aiming to get elected President, a role which requires one to be decisive and fit to serve as two of the most primary prerequisites.\n\nI remain baffled by the way Biden’s original VP guarantee has been almost unanimously applauded and totally uncontroversial in the media. If Biden knew his pick already and she was a woman, I would have had no problem with him saying so a few months ago without prematurely revealing her identity at that stage. That was clearly not the case.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Biden had no idea who he was going to pick when he made that guarantee to help secure the primary. This has been demonstrated by months of indecision on the matter with several names moving up and down the leaderboard of his most likely picks. This, to me, makes his guarantee an unfortunate one, though I try to give him the benefit of the doubt that his intentions were good at best and simply to get votes at worst.\n\nThat said, if I was a woman, I cannot imagine that I would want the first female Vice President to be selected this way, with the fact that she is a woman being the first and most outwardly advertised criteria. Furthermore, it now seems that our potential next VP’s race has become the second most necessary qualification, although Biden has not as explicitly said so.\n\nI believe that the first female Vice President deserves to be selected at least apparently because she is the best person for the job, not just because she is the best woman for the job or the best black woman for the job. She should be chosen as the best candidate from a field that includes the best of the best regardless of gender or race. Anything else suggests that no woman is capable of landing the position by merit and that is so obviously not true.\n\nHave people already forgotten that Hillary won the popular vote last election? We were well on our way to having our first female President well before this ugly and unnecessary VP guarantee.\n\nBarack Obama won back to back elections to become the first black President. Can you imagine how much less meaningful that would have been if he was instead elected after we decided as a country that we were only going to pick from a pool of black candidates that year? Americans decided he was the best person for the job. That’s how it should be.\n\nBiden’s VP selection comes with added consequence considering he would become the oldest President in America’s history on his first day in The Oval Office. Assuming he makes it through his first term, which is all but guaranteed, it seems doubtful that he would run for a second one. That would leave his VP as the candidate closest to being an incumbent and, all else equal, the most likely to win.\n\nTo be clear, I look forward to the day we have our first female President. I just hope she rises to power via election by the people of America, not via selection by the consultants of a presidential candidate who are only looking to assure the greatest possible benefit to his polls."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Universities' New Freemium Strategy\n\nLast night, I started a college class for the first time since I graduated in 2017. The weekend prior, I was accepted to Stanford. Well, not exactly. I was accepted to an experimental online class from Stanford called Code in Place which is based on the school's well-regarded CS106A Programming Methodology course.\n\nAfter being rejected by Stanford twice, once for undergraduate coming out of my gap year in 2013 and a second time for their Deferred Enrollment MBA program in 2017, it was nice to finally get some good news back from the Silicon Valley school where Google was born and [Steve Jobs spoke](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/13/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech-2005/).\n\nFor the record, I consider myself very fortunate to have received both of those rejections because, without them, everything afterwards would have changed. I choose to appreciate everything about my past because I do not see much benefit in wondering how things could have gone differently or wishing for ways in which they could have.\n\nAnyway, a combination of discovering this course from Stanford one day, [a class from Yale ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being)the next day, and [a number of classes from Harvard](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/catalog/free) the day after that made me realize that the coming shift in higher education has already begun.\n\nBefore speculating upon what that shift may look like, it is important to acknowledge that one of two things is likely to happen, and they represent very different scenarios. The first scenario is easier to imagine but harder for me to believe which is that universities will open up again next fall as if it is business, or rather, education as usual. This seems unlikely to me, but with an accelerated path to an effective vaccine or the introduction of some other unforeseen factor, I am hesitant to count it out completely while it still remains within the realm of possibility from my perspective. The second scenario which I believe is much more likely is that we will not go back to education as usual in the fall. Instead, education will continue to be online as it has been for the last few weeks under the guise of a temporary solution to be relied on only during this thought to be relatively short-lived shelter-in-place period. This shift to online education is somewhat obvious and predictable if in fact circumstances remain several months from now so that live in-person classes in the physical world will no longer be feasible, practical, or responsible, and it is important to remember that if any institution is going to risk lives and people's health, liberal arts colleges are probably the least likely of them all to do so. What is not as obvious or easily predictable from my perspective is how the new digital format for classes will change countless other aspects of higher education and society at large.\n\nScott Galloway had an excellent monologue on this subject in the most recent episode of his eponymous podcast, The Prof G Show. (For those who read [a previous post in which I tried to use the word eponymous but somewhat forced it](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/30/the-weekend-miscellaneous-7-six-easy-pieces-burn-after-reading-bedminster-pizza-ttyl-bombshell/), hopefully we can agree this usage was much cleaner and closer to correct.) In his monologue, Scott talks about how elite universities have become the ultimate luxury brands by rejecting over 90% of their prospective customers otherwise known as students unlike even the most luxurious brands in the world like Rolex or Louis Vuitton or Rolls Royce would ever consider doing. He talks about how the value-add of universities lies as much or more in the certification than in the education and how higher education is ripe for disruption based on what he calls a disruptability index which he defines as \"a function of your ability to increase prices faster than inflation without having any underlying increase in productivity of the product.\" I liked that straight forward definition. Lastly, Scott talks about how schools will still want to make money and says that they will need to accept many more students in order to maintain revenues because their excessive prices, which have already garnered plenty of attention but which to date have been unrelenting due to continued demand, will now become much more egregiously apparent to even the wealthiest of parents who will have no choice but to ask why they are paying $50,000 a year for their child to join 3 or 4, 20- or 200- person Zoom classes per day, five or even only four or three days per week, taught by someone who seems less effective at online education than the people who teach the free Khan Academy videos. The college price tag that used to be justified by not only the certification but the overall experience and the access to resources and the dining hall and the dorms and the people to meet and the lifelong relationships to form, in addition to the hopefully premium version of an actual education which I am by no means discounting but simply pales in comparison to the monetary value that the word Wharton on a resume affords an individual to more easily earn over their lifetime compared to another individual with the word of a university that you or I and therefore most employers have never heard of or do not regard as good, let alone great or elite.\n\nSo, how will it happen that schools will begin to accept more students from whom they can generate lower revenues per student to equal the same or similar revenues as they are accustomed to? I believe we are seeing the beginning of it now, and if that is any indication of the speed and magnitude of the change, it looks poised to be large and fast.\n\nI never previously had the opportunity to be a student at an Ivy League school. Already I now have the opportunity to become a student at all of them, for free. I think what we are seeing now is a land grab, or in more literal terms, a student grab. I believe the top schools are foreseeing the coming disruption of themselves and others and have come to the same conclusion that they need to expand their student base. Based on what I have seen thus far, it seems to me that they are beginning to test and implement a tried and true strategy that has been successful for so many tech and media companies before them, and that is, the freemium strategy.\n\nElite universities are now giving away their most basic offerings for free to get as many students on board as they possibly can so that the base is as large as possible for them to upsell once they figure out how exactly they want to do that based on what they believe will be the best way to monetize their student base which will soon be degrees of magnitude larger than ever before for schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and hopefully my alma mater too. I say hopefully because by default the schools that do not grow will shrink, not only in students but in relevance and prominence and therefore in the benefits that graduates will experience by having their schools' names on their resumes.\n\nPremium products will be varying and virtually limitless and the prices for the very best of them I imagine will be very steep. For example, one may be able to take an intro to macroeconomics class from Harvard for free but the advanced classes as one works his or her way up the chain of prerequisites to the land of advanced electives will cost money, likely more and more of it as the student advances further. Alternatively, I suppose all of those classes could remain free and the approach to charging for premium offerings could be focused more on gaining access to smaller classes or ones with more small group Zoom meetings or ones with better professors with better reviews. Perhaps professors will be paid more like restaurant workers in that they are given a nominal wage in exchange for their work and the opportunity to earn large tips from generous diners for their excellent service, or in this case, ad-hoc income from wealthier students for their one-on-one tutoring sessions or access to office hours. Unlike most restaurant workers, some professors could make an absolute killing this way.\n\nI am not sure exactly how all of this will take shape but I am reasonably confident that if higher education is heading in a digital direction, as it appears to be, then the freemium model will be widely employed. As a result, many more people worldwide will have access to the best schools in the world, which is a good thing, but people will still have to pay potentially steep prices for things like certification which unfortunately are unreasonably valued by top employers making their seemingly unreasonable prices unfortunately reasonable. I'm taking the Code in Place class from Stanford for the next five weeks and I expect to gain the valuable new skill of basic programming for free which is awesome and amazing, but was not surprised when I read in no uncertain terms before applying that I would not be getting any sort of university credit or certification for completing the class. Of course, that would be far too valuable to give away for free. Schools will give away the product but not the certification, because that is the biggest part of what people have been paying for all long. One question I am curious to see answered is what happens when I and the 10,000 other students taking this Code in Place Stanford class with me put it on their resumes anyway? What happens if employers start caring less about where you learned and more about what you know? I suppose as with most things these days, we will just have to do our best to guess, or otherwise wait to find out."}]}

That said, I was sincerely surprised by both the quantity and quality of outreach I received in response to [my first request for startup](https://blogofjake.com/2021/01/04/request-for-startup-a-new-kind-of-podcast-platform/) posted just over one month ago as of this writing.\n\nWithin 48 hours of the post, I had [assembled of team](https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1346866656065294339?s=20) of six individuals including myself who were interested in contributing to the project in whatever ways they could (coding, funding, design, etc.). This team has been meeting once weekly ever since and will soon have a simple solution to show for it. I look forward to sharing it at the appropriate time.\n\nMaybe most surprising to me has been the persistence of messages I have received weeks after the original post, perhaps because I have not posted another blog since, or perhaps because the idea has struck a chord with many more people than I would have thought, or perhaps because my following is larger and/or more engaged with my blog specifically than I had presumed from its less than 100 email subscribers (99 as of this writing). Perhaps the reception has resulted from a combination of all of these factors and more. Regardless of the reason, below you can see some screenshots (with sender names removed) from a few messages that I have received in the last 48 hours alone.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db7f305-4bfe-4df2-83e4-e88a1a507ce4_856x861.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db7f305-4bfe-4df2-83e4-e88a1a507ce4_856x861.png)#1 - this guy is from Europe and there may be nothing I enjoy more than people reaching out from around the world\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc94cb4b-18dd-41d6-b03f-893959de027d_844x234.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc94cb4b-18dd-41d6-b03f-893959de027d_844x234.png)#2 - woke up with this email in my inbox this morning and haven't yet responded so he may be surprised to see it here\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4409e856-cb25-4961-820c-d23ef1fe3ceb_620x286.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4409e856-cb25-4961-820c-d23ef1fe3ceb_620x286.png)#3 - he typed \"elf\" but he meant \"elad\" referring to my podcast episode with Elad Gil which you can listen to [here](https://podofjake.com/2021/02/11/45-elad-gil/)\n\nThe overall response to my first request for startup has not been quite as crazy as one might assume based on the activity I shared from the first 48 hours and the screenshots above from the last 48 hours, but still, the quantity and quality of responses from these 96 hours alone has been far greater than what I had ever expected to receive from the original post.\n\nAnyway, I am now quite curious to see if the success from the first request for startup can be replicated a second time and in a reliable way moving forward. I tweeted the other day about one of the coolest aspects of all I have been doing:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1359495554280132612?s=20\n\nIf in becoming a magnet for people working on interesting things I have also become a magnet for people interested in working on interesting things, it may be that I could regularly post ideas on here which I wish someone would build, and that with a little help from me and a lot of work from others, some of them will get built. From my perspective, I am here to provide an initial idea, a spark to action, and a Schelling point where people interested in working on a particular project can meet. I am also here to connect the people who gravitate to the project through me in this regard, to organize the founding team, and to help them however I can (product, team, funding, distribution) with a small and decreasing time commitment along the way so that I may continue to help new projects get started in perpetuity.\n\nOn the subject of helping new projects get started, let me segue into the first of two new kinds of match apps that I have been thinking about lately which together will serve as my second request for startup, as is implied by the title of this post. If both ideas gain traction, perhaps we will get a 2-for-1 out of this second RFS. With increased expectations after the first go-around, my hope is that at least one of these two ideas will be at least as half as interesting to half as many people as the first one was, and that would be plenty enough interest to build off of and get another project underway.\n\n### **Match App #1**\n\nThe first new kind of match app would be for the purpose of introducing co-founders. Think \"Tinder for Co-Founders\". The purpose of the app would be to pair technical and business-minded co-founders, builders and storytellers, coding missionaries and product visionaries. I fundamentally believe that many more people could start great companies than those who do and that the reason why many of them don't is because they are missing the complementary co-founder they believe they need to do so. This would set out to solve that problem. Think of it as a place where Woz meets Jobs. An exceptional outcome would be if the _pair_ of founders that starts the next _Apple_ were to meet through this app. Naturally, we will call it _Pear_.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cc77489-8255-49e1-b1d8-5591237a7c79_680x678.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cc77489-8255-49e1-b1d8-5591237a7c79_680x678.jpeg)\n\nThe above image I found on Google could serve as inspiration if anyone wants to draft and submit a possible logo.\n\nIn addition to the name and logo, I also bring with the introduction of this idea a proposed mission statement as follows:\n\n> “We believe startups are good for the world. Our mission is to help more start and succeed.”\n\nAs I did with the first request for startup, I will offer a few features of the product which I think could be important and help to paint a picture of what this could be and how it could work. First, it would be important to build an effectively leveragable network through the app so that the users (founders) can help each other, not only the partners who they meet, but the broader network of founding pairs. In this way, the app would begin to function as a founder community and digital incubator of sorts. The company can gradually develop a group of successful entrepreneurs and investors who are willing to share their time with the founders in the community. Think the kinds of people whom I have had on [my podcast](http://podofjake.com). Eventually, those who emerge successfully from this ecosystem would circle back to further empower it. It would not be exactly like YC, but it would not be totally unlike YC either. One key difference is that it starts earlier. You typically go to YC with your founding team in place and an idea worked out, if not a company already started. None of these prerequisites are necessary to go and meet your cofounder on _Pear_. Eventually, it would be much easier to raise money as a pair of founders from _Pear_ than it would be to do so without.\n\nThe introduction of the initial cofounders and the endless list of benefits which would accumulate with time to those in the network would come at a cost of perhaps as low as 1% equity in the company -- and that would be the best part. The whole thing is a bet on itself. The incentives are inseparably aligned. _Pear_ would be better off facilitating the start of one extremely successful company than one thousand duds. What I have described is just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more to be conceived of and done. I personally think it could get very interesting. If it sounds at all interesting to you too, I will look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to email me at [jake@blogofjake.com](mailto:jake@blogofjake.com) or message me on Twitter [@blogofjake](https://twitter.com/blogofjake).\n\n### **Match App #** 2\n\nThe second new kind of match app would be for a similar use case as the one Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and whatever other match apps are out there (which I am happily not a user of) claim to be for. The difference between my idea and the apps that already exist is that this new match app would be audio-only. The seed of the idea actually came to me from a scene in the movie _Her_ (from 6:50 - 10:00 if you want to check it out with full disclosure that it is inappropriate) where the main character played by Joaquin Phoenix gets in bed and pops his Airpods into in his ears. Of course, they were not actually Airpods as the movie came out 3 years before the first Airpods were released, but they looked and functioned just like the popular pods which we have now come to know as Apple's latest killer product. Anyway, Phoenix's character puts in his Airpods and tells his headphones' version of Siri, \"go to chatroom standard search\" which, for him, Siri reports back, is \"adult female, can't sleep, and want to have some fun\". This predictably leads to a few options of women in audio-swiping succession who fit the description that he was looking for and he ends up having a nightmarish experience with the one he ultimately ends up matching with.\n\nDespite the particulars and the negative outcome of his experience, I actually think the concept of an audio-only matching app can be quite interesting and does not need to be so explicitly sex-oriented, superficial, or transactional as it is in the movie. Tinder and the others have more or less stooped to acting as such sex-oriented, superficial, and transactional service themselves and actually the reason for my idea to exist in the first place is to offer a more human alternative to those apps. I still think the best app for introducing people in a meaningful way that can lead to more long-lasting romantic relationships has yet to be made, and I believe the answer is audio.\n\nThe existing match apps use some combination of pictures and self-descriptions and sometimes some self-selected preferences to match people. While a broad set of information might be collected, in practice it generally degrades into users making split-second yes or no judgements based on a picture or two which likely doesn't even accurately represent the person's true physical attractiveness as you might perceive it in real life let alone their overall attractiveness including their personality and who they are in a fuller sense. Of course, I am by no means denying the fact that physical attractiveness plays a large part in overall attraction and relationships, but I refuse to believe that it is the only factor for everyone. I think it could be good for people to have the opportunity to get to know each other a bit through conversation before they see each other or read any self-descriptions of one another or anything else that tends to be shallow and put people in boxes that are not necessarily true or fair. In the end, the other person's looks could be a deal-breaker for one person or the other but perhaps they could then part in a respectful and unoffensive way after having gotten to know and like each other at least enough to proceed to the point where they could meet over video or in real life and have a drink or a bite to eat with someone they otherwise never would have taken the time to get to know.\n\nThere would be challenges from the beginning as there are with almost any network effects business but I think that, for example, the problem of going onto the app and not getting matched because there is not enough traffic could be solved by restricting the app in its early days to only operate, for example, between 5-6pm in a given time zone. Another problem could be that the system could be taken advantage of by bad actors but I think there are several ways to prevent that from happening through a simple reporting system or a 0-1 rating system where people can confirm that the person they talked to was not being a blatantly bad actor.\n\nAgain, I think it could be interesting. If you do too, my email is [jake@blogofjake.com](mailto:jake@blogofjake.com) and my Twitter is [@blogofjake](https://twitter.com/blogofjake).\n\nI look forward to hearing from you."}]}

My family calls her Mom-mom.\n\nI heard from my mother that Mom-mom was planning to go to the grocery store to get a few things, so I called Mom-mom again yesterday to ask her what she needed. I told her that I could order it to be delivered to her doorstep instead. I told her I wanted to do that.\n\nMom-mom lives in Florida. She is 85 years old. She told me on Sunday that she had never seen anything like this and it all really felt like a movie. She had also never seen anything like grocery delivery service through Amazon, and I could hardly get her to tell me anything she needed from the store. I have found that one of the ways in which I am most different from most people is that I make an effort to welcome and even seek change because change is the only constant and it is the means by which we grow. The human tendency, however, (and my natural inclination is no different) is to fear change, to resist it, to avoid it all costs. That is why a lot of people are refusing to comply with social distancing until they are forced to do so by law or by closure of the place they usually go. That is also why Mom-mom just wanted to go to the grocery store, because that is what she always does.\n\nStill, I managed to get her to tell me that she eats eggs and cooks pasta and uses almond milk. We agreed I would wait to hear from her tomorrow after she went to the store in case she could not get anything there, but I thought I could change her mind if I showed her what was possible. I ordered the three things that she mentioned and some chocolate (the one other thing I knew she would eat) from Whole Foods on Amazon at 3:01pm yesterday. The package was delivered at 5:02pm.\n\nIn the midst of all this madness, I am truly amazed by Amazon. They made a 2 hour and 1 minute delivery from order click to delivery confirmation during a global pandemic when the company is well into uncharted territory in terms of its demand. I acted unimpressed when Mom-mom called me to tell me I fooled her and that she got the food because I wanted her to think it was all no big deal nowadays so that she would accept it moving forward instead of going out. The fact of the matter, however, is that it is a big deal. The reality is that it is not normal. What Amazon did yesterday, what it is doing today, and what it will do again tomorrow and the next day and the next day could not have been done at this scale with this speed in this crazy environment at any other time in the history of the world.\n\nIt is for reasons like this that I cannot be convinced that all technology is all bad, or that the big companies are all evil, or that the people who run them are all greedy and ill-willed. They may not be perfect, nobody is, but many of them are doing what they can to build what they believe will be a better world, and many of them, like Amazon, have done an unbelievable job. Whenever I decide to dip back into the stock market, Amazon is the first company that I will buy a share in.

As TV channels are to TV shows, this podcast channel is to podcast shows. We will curate the very best podcast episodes for techno-optimists and post them all on one podcast channel, so you can get them all in one feed.\n\n_TECHNO-OPTIMISTS_ represents the crystallization of two ideas that I have had for a long time.\n\nThe first idea was to create a podcast of podcasts in general. Many good new things have come as a result of [bundling and unbundling](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling). For example, albums were unbundled into songs which were re-bundled into streaming subscriptions. A podcast of podcasts is simply the bundling of podcasts. Podcasts are still a relatively new and yet to be bundled form of media. I believe they should be. I believe they will be. As for how this attempt will do, we will see.\n\nThe second idea was to create a content hub for techno-optimists. A few years ago, I created what I called _The Techno-Progressive Content Library_. It was a simple Google Sheet with lists of pro-tech movies, shows, books, and other forms of media depicting a positive vision of the future. These types of titles are relatively few and far between in our world of mostly anti-tech, dystopian movies, shows, books, and other forms of media, so we thought it would be helpful to organize them all in one place for the kinds of people who believe we can build a better future with technology.\n\nI never knew exactly what to call these kinds of people -- people like my podcast guests, like my audience, like myself. I've tried several variations of overlapping terms like [techno-progressive](https://x.com/0FJAKE/status/1304370293130104832?s=20), [technological ](https://x.com/0FJAKE/status/1349203260641570816?s=20)[progressive](https://x.com/0FJAKE/status/1342929684628176898?s=20), and [technoptimist](https://x.com/0FJAKE/status/1688364378834231296?s=20). But a few weeks ago, Marc Andreessen did us all a favor with his post, _[The Techno-Optimist Manifesto](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/)_. I predict his prominence and prose will retrospectively prove to have had the power to align us all on one term from here forward -- \"Techno-Optimist\" -- and maybe this will do a little bit to help.\n\nTechno-Optimist is probably the best one-word descriptor of the kinds of people I've had on my podcast since Day 1, and the kinds of people who listen. I now have [3 years of techno-optimist episodes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pod-of-jake/id1525087226?uo=4) under my belt. So I figured if there is anyone to create a podcast of podcasts for techno-optimists, why not me?\n\nI pulled it all together this weekend and we're live on Apple, Spotify, etc. with a few initial episodes -- a few of my favorite conversations with a few of the most inspiring techno-optimists I've been lucky to have on Pod of Jake. The plan is of course to post episodes from other people's podcasts as well, hence the whole \"podcast of podcasts\" thing, so please [let me know](mailto:jake@blogofjake.com) if you have a podcast you'd like to be featured as I work to source some others myself.\n\nFor now, check out our website at [techno-optimists.com](http://techno-optimists.com) and follow us on X/Twitter [@TechnoOptimists](https://twitter.com/TechnoOptimists). Subscribe to the channel and leave a review on [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/techno-optimists/id1717255313) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6oYKfi4nymGyWPXWQHpdYX?si=6dcf774cef8e4160).\n\nAs always, I appreciate your support."}]}

In another hundred days, I expect to be in the best shape of my life still, but that best will be better than this one, and I intend for that trend to continue on for a while.\n\nI have never been in great shape before. I would hesitate to say that I have ever even been in good shape. In high school, I played basketball (starting only because our team was awful) and lacrosse (barely), but I only ever liked to play. I never really liked to train, and I never really did much of anything that I didn't like to do, so I never really did any sort of training at all. In sprints, suicides, and 17s (named for the number of times we had to run across the basketball court), I was always near the back of the pack. I was physically beat because I was mentally weak, not for a lack of will, I do not think, but rather, a lack of knowledge about, experience with, and belief in a number of ways by which I could systematically improve my steady state, ways in which I could grow and get better.\n\nWhen I was 19, I left the university I was at to start my own company. The venture failed, but the experience instilled in me a belief in the positive power of positivity, and in the rewards which are granted to those who dare to be different. My gap year made me realize that I could effectively improve myself as a person, and my three-year education in human and organizational development that followed helped train my brain to see the world from a perspective which would allow me to do just that.\n\nAfter graduation, I moved out to San Francisco to begin a job in investment banking. Journaling every morning was the first thing that I noticed helped me wire my brain in a positive way. I do the same thing today that I did then. Open a blank, lined page in a medium-sized notebook, write the date at the top, underline it, write a first sentence that says, \"Today is going to be an X day\", where X is some positive word like good, great, excellent, awesome, or extraordinary, and continue on to fill the page with sentences of intentional positivity and gratitude until I run out of room, often ending with a sentence about how lucky I am. If you write something as if you believe it over and over again, it does not very much matter whether you do or not, eventually, you will.\n\nI have written in previous posts about a number of other habits that I have introduced and/or practiced over the years, but today my intention is to write about running, and more specifically, reasons to run.\n\nWith that said, the following reasons are some of the many why I run, in no particular order. Maybe some of them will inspire you to do the same. I hope they do, but if nothing else, this will be a great reference for me to come back to if ever my conviction in running weakens, or if my belief in its merits become faded or forgotten.\n\nDiscipline - this must be one of the most important characteristics to develop. Fortunately, I believe it is in my blood from both parents, but that does not mean it did not have to be actively awakened and developed. For a while, I used to take cold showers every morning. That is a good way to learn about discipline. The first day it sucks. The next day it sucks. It continues to suck until one day you realize it doesn't suck that much anymore. Some days you might even enjoy it. Part of discipline to me is about doing things that you do not want to do over and over again until they are no longer painful or hard, until you no longer dread them, and until you can sometimes or even most of the time come to enjoy them. Discipline is also about much more than that. As much as discipline is about doing things we do not necessarily want to do, it may be more about not doing things that we want to do but which we know are not good. It takes discipline for many people to cut back on drinking, smoking, binge eating, binge movie-watching, or binge anything you are tempted to binge. More than only doing and not doing, discipline is about a third thing as well. Discipline can be exhibited in the way we do things, demonstrated by how we do them. Running five times per week as I have hit my literal and figurative stride over the last couple of months has helped me become more disciplined in all three of these ways. The first is by just doing it. Some days my runs are enjoyable but many days they are not. I do them for all of the reasons I am writing about but none of them are explicitly about enjoyment. Running keeps me disciplined to do things daily that I believe in but do not necessarily want to do. The second and third ways in which running has made me more disciplined, these ones related to the not doing and the way we do things, are drawn from a beautiful quote that I often am reminded of from my friend Eric. Eric, more than anyone, deserves credit for convincing me on the merits of running and kickstarting my training which has persisted to this day. That began back when we were traveling around Japan for a few weeks last fall, by train and by foot. During a run one day, he told me something like this, \"we must have the ambition to go fast, but the discipline to go slow\". From this, it becomes obvious that the thing to be disciplined enough not to do while running is to go too fast and that the disciplined way to do it is to go slow. It feels nice to run a mile or two and improve upon your time by pushing harder and harder and harder, but these quick hits of dopamine released by the satisfaction of speed-related achievements do not last long. They are fleeting, like all things, and they will not allow you to experience many of the other benefits of running and the reasons to run that I am about to continue on writing about.\n\nPatience - closely intertwined with the prior reason to run, patience is a virtue that both requires discipline and is required to build it. Running far, slowly, is less about testing your lungs or your legs than it is about testing your mind. I once had Siri take a note in a moment of clarity while I was on a run. It said, \"Running is all about pain. Pace takes threshold. Distance takes tolerance.\" To run far, one must learn to tolerate and eventually accept the uncomfortable state of running in which breathing is more difficult and the body is constantly working. We must normalize the feeling of hitting the ground over and over again through the impact of one foot which, without any chance against the relentless force of gravity, must will itself anyway to push one's body weight off of the ground and forward once more. \"Onwards and upwards\", as Eric and I said. In a world in which Ivy League educated psychologists are employed by media and social media companies to help guide developers on how best to program computers to automatically gain and keep our attention, it is more essential than ever, I would argue, to develop patience. It is crucial to build the ability to keep one's attention on something chosen, something good, and to stick with whatever that might be without any immediate expectations of a return, or a dopamine hit, or a like. Just a number of months ago, I used to become impatient running on a treadmill for a single mile or two. Three miles was daunting and seriously tested my patience. Now I run outside, and that helps, and in the last couple of months I have never run less than three miles, and I have developed the patience to keep running for an hour or even two or more for the longer runs, and I hope to go longer than that.\n\nNature - this is the critical element that in combination with building patience has helped me to run longer. Most people do not spend a lot of time in nature. We mostly see it outside of home and office windows, through car windshields, or on TV. We literally sit inside and put outside on a screen. Most agree that seeing nature pales in comparison with experiencing it, and running presents a great opportunity to do just that. Another friend I credit largely for giving me the inspiration to start running regularly in the first place is my buddy Jack, alongside whom I survived my first year of investment banking out in San Francisco. I asked him for a quote to include with my post today and he sent me 100 words that he wrote on the theme of \"blue skies\" for a ritual in which his dad, his brother and him are writing 100 words a day with a given theme. Here is what Jack wrote about blue skies, \"Blue skies beckon me to the streets, like swells call a surfer or lamps summon a bug, for a rare mid-day run. Past equestrian statues and up hills, across storied bridges where Taft strode and towards streams where Teddy stripped, supposedly, I descend into Rock Creek, the wooded oasis where Georgetown and Kalorama converge like summer and winter collapse into spring. Thoughts of work release from the kink in my neck, rising like steam before fizzling in a poof or dripping in a bead of sweat. So it seems, for blue skies I have come, and blue skies I've become.\" Some days, I question whether my writing is any good at all. After reading this passage from Jack, this became one of those days. Nonetheless, running enhances my connection with nature, and Jack's, it would seem, even more so.\n\nMeditation - going back to Jack's quote, it is not all about nature. I love his line about thoughts of work releasing from the kink in his neck, rising like steam before fizzling in a poof or dripping in a bead of sweat. I texted him back, \"To me it sounds like a meditation of sorts, without taking on the baggage that that can take, it is about witnessing thoughts and letting them pass, rising and falling as you say.\" He texted me back, \"Exactly. You get it entirely.\" We are on the same page because we share similar perspectives I am sure, but more than anything, because we run. We know what it is like to notice thoughts come and go over the course of hours in which we are running in perpetual motion. We understand what it feels like to have our bodies run with our minds still, a welcomed change from having our minds run with our bodies still. Running can be a meditation of sorts, especially, I have found, without headphones giving me audio to focus on.\n\nPodcasts - although running without headphones, in my opinion, can be the most meditative, over the last couple of months, I most often have listened to podcasts while running. Earlier this week, I wrote about how I have committed to the practice of [smoga ](https://blogofjake.com/2020/04/07/smoga-stretching-meditation-yoga/)because it combines three things I think would be worth my time into one thing that I know must be worth it. Beyond the fact that I have really come to enjoy listening to podcasts while running, I do it because it takes two things I think would be worth my time and turns them into one thing that I know must be worth it. I listen to podcasts mostly as a means of learning, and a very enjoyable means at that, and I figure if I can spend an hour or so most days running while learning, well, that is not going to be an hour of that day that I regret. I never got into running as much until I got into podcasting and I never got into podcasting as much until I got into running.\n\nGrowth - in the introduction of this post, I wrote about how I developed a desire to develop myself. This concept can best be described as a growth mindset. Having committed to a growth mindset years ago before I even had the term to describe it, I do not feel very well if I start feeling stagnant for too long, or like I am becoming complacent with the way that things are or the way that I am, or worse than any of that, like I am actually getting worse. That feels as though I am wasting the amazing opportunity unlike any other, that is, the opportunity of life. I understand that one day my mind and my body may begin to decline in a way that is at least in some part outside of my control, but for now I am 25-years-old, and anything I have done to date is nothing in comparison to my potential. I must grow into that potential slowly and over time, and running helps me to maintain that growth mindset, as well as the patience and discipline to grow slow. I know that the longer I do anything, the further I can go. The longer I keep running, the further I can go, and over time, running slow becomes less and less slow, until it is fast, but still feels slow. Grow to run and one will run to grow. That is the way that it has worked for me at least.\n\nThere are many other reasons to run, some that I not have not yet discovered and other that I have but am forgetting. One can run so that one may learn that life is not a race, so that one may experience the saying that \"it is a marathon and not a sprint\", so that one can feel true hunger and true thirst and the satisfaction of relieving them, so that one can become grateful, so that one can feel good. Running has made me healthier and for all the above reasons and more which describe why I do it, running, in and of itself, is one of the biggest reasons why I am in the best physical, mental, and overall shape of my life. With great discipline, patience, hunger, and health, among many other gifts for which I am grateful, I will continue to run, and I will continue to grow."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Escaping The Pro-Aging Trance: Hope for Longer, Healthier Lives\n\nOne of my more controversial beliefs is that people of my generation may live radically longer and healthier than any generation of humans in history. Whether radically means 20%, 50%, 2x, or more than 5x longer, I cannot say, but I believe by attacking the process of aging directly, scientists and technologists may find effective ways to extend the human healthspan. By doing so, we would buy ourselves additional time to make additional breakthroughs in slowing, stopping, and/or reversing aging so that eventually we may reach _[longevity escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity_escape_velocity)_. This term, coined by Aubrey de Grey, represents a hypothetical situation in which we would be extending life expectancy faster than we would be aging. The almost unimaginable implication of achieving such a state is that humans could potentially dodge death in perpetuity, hypothetically living not necessarily forever, but perhaps for as long as we wanted.\n\nI will not put a probability on this scenario, and my hopes for my own healthspan are certainly more conservative, for the time being at least, but there is an idea that often comes up in opposition to the possibility of extending human healthspan which is important to address. Aubrey defines the sort of trapped thinking which I would like to help some people escape as the _pro-aging trance_. Listen to the 90-second explanation from 4:35 - 6:05 (47:42 - 46:12 remaining) which Aubrey gave in the podcast episode I recorded with him earlier this year.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/5jHo9s5ursqbC4IaUk6OIz?si=p201ICMUTnKNWo0e17F9mA\n\nAs Aubrey explains, for all of human history, it has made sense to rationalize death and aging as best we could because the possibility of living 50% or 2x or 5x longer or indefinitely seemed impossible. If solving aging and defeating death is hopeless, which it was, it of course makes sense to justify why it would be bad and undesirable even if the reasons we use to justify that don’t make sense (over-population, food shortage, death giving meaning to life, etc.).\n\nIt is important today to recognize that what seemed impossible in the past may, in fact, only be difficult. I don't write that to trivialize the difficulty of an achievement so ambitious as reversing aging, but rather to clearly differentiate that which is difficult from that which is impossible. This is an extremely important distinction to make because impossible achievements are not worth pursuing whereas difficult pursuits may be the most worthwhile of all, especially if the reward is something so significant as to successfully help humans live meaningfully longer and healthier lives.\n\nFor those who may be wondering what has changed to make what once seemed impossible suddenly (in the context of human history) within striking distance, it is important to appreciate not only the potential of new and exciting technologies like [CRISPR](https://www.newscientist.com/term/what-is-crispr/#:~:text=CRISPR%20is%20a%20technology%20that,alter%20that%20piece%20of%20DNA.) and [stem cell therapies](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html), but also the recent achievements along the relevant metrics which have already been accomplished. The first two milestones which I mentioned above (living 50% or 2x longer) have already been reached in the last ~100 years as per this incredibly hopeful chart below:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F594fbd29-e065-402d-a4b6-2b8d11f8ca4e_1024x722.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F594fbd29-e065-402d-a4b6-2b8d11f8ca4e_1024x722.png)\n\nPeople argue against the continuation of this chart by contending that it was mostly due to decreasing child mortality and infectious diseases and that we would need new angles to extend the trend much further. This observation is reasonably fair but to argue that those new angles are not possible just because they have not yet been achieved is not. If you looked at this same chart going back centuries or even millennia it would look flat forever with just a small vertical blip at the end. Just because child mortality and infectious diseases were the first big ticket items which we tackled does not mean that there are no others for us to solve. I believe humanity will one day reflect on the last century or so of increasing human healthspan as phase 1 of the process and that targeting aging directly and materially increasing not just the average but the maximum human healthspan will be phase 2.\n\nFor the same sensible reasons that the pro-aging trance exists in the first place, it is a somewhat dangerous game even now to start believing you can live healthfully well past 100 before the technology to do so is evidently here. Without further technological advancements, the chances would remain that you will be wrong, and the thought of having hope for something which may never come to fruition is always scary. Still, people buy lottery tickets everyday and dare to dream of what they would buy with their winnings even though such an outcome has far lesser odds in their favor. The risk of hope in any instance is that you may well be disappointed in the end, but the reward is that the thing you hope for becomes reality, and in most cases that never could have happened had you never dared to dream when it seemed unlikely.\n\nIn humanity's quest to live longer and healthier lives, we need some people to start believing it is possible or even probable before it necessarily makes perfect sense to do so. The growing group of early believers brings attention to the efforts which in turn brings funding which accelerates progress so that we may achieve milestones like the doubling of healthspans in mice. The achievement of every milestone bring incrementally more believers and eventually defeating death may become the probable destiny that the people in the beginning believed even before it was true. This is similar to the way those who believed Bitcoin would become what it has over the last decade were irrational when they held that belief in the beginning but are now recognized as having been right.\n\nI am not asking you to believe people will be able to live healthy lives for as long as they desire. All I am suggesting is that you open your mind to the potential that living longer and healthier lives may be possible within our lifetimes, and more importantly, that such a thing would be inherently good. Commonly cited problems like over-population and food shortages are far from unsolvable. In fact, many have argued in the past that we could not sustain the populations we have now, but here we are. These arguments and others which oppose efforts to extend the human healthspan have been conveniently used to excuse us historically from having false hope for something that seemed impossible, but it is now time for us to realize the irrational nature of these excuses and the rational reasons for believing we can live longer and healthier lives. If one would not desire to live youthfully well beyond 100 and experience a shorter period of suffering at the end of a longer life, the problem is less likely to be with the new way of dying than with one's current way of living.\n\nI believe this is the best time to be alive in the history of humanity. I believe the future will be even better. I believe we can live longer, healthier, and happier lives. Do you dare to join to me?"}]}

Along with fresh strawberries as well as other fruits and vegetables, they sold rose sculptures and Hanukkah menorahs made from the metal of actual rockets that had landed on Israeli soil. I learned at the farm that pigeons are able to deliver mail because, once released, they are led by some magnetic sense in their beak to fly home, with precision down to a few feet. I also learned how important bees remain to the prosperity of humans through their uniquely effective abilities in pollination. Later that evening we arrived at a large tent in the desert. After a meditation led by the Israelis in our group, it was inside of that tent where we slept.\n\nIn the morning we rode camels. It was cool for a few minutes, but I did feel sorry for them. We were told that camels can live longer (up to 25 years) under the “care” of humans, but the value of having free will to roam in the desert seems like it would be worth at least a few years to me.\n\nIn the sunniest hours of the winter day in the desert we hiked through canyons, saw David Ben Gurion’s tomb, and toured Be’er Sheva, which in the last half century has been home to many Sephardic Jews. During that time, the southern city has not been regarded as a place where many would want to go for any reason other than for university (Ben Gurion University of the Negev) or to volunteer. Over the last few years however that has begun to change and it makes me curious to look into whether Be’er Sheva might be an attractive area to invest in through real estate or otherwise at some point in the future.\n\nTomorrow we hike Masada and go see the Dead Sea before making our way to Jerusalem."}]}

Jeff Bezos calls it the _regret minimization framework_ and he credits it for helping him to make his decision to start Amazon which in 2018 made him not only the richest person in the world, but the richest person in modern history.\n\nI figured if anyone's approach to decision-making was worth considering in crafting my own, that of the richest person in modern history might be a worthwhile place to start. To this day, it continues to be a framework that I come back to more often than any other when making big decisions especially.\n\nRegardless of what you do in life, I assume that you are a human and I have yet to meet one who does not make any decisions. By that logic, even without knowing you, I can be certain that a useful framework for decision-making will be useful for you. I cannot know whether or not you will find this particular framework to be useful, but I strongly urge that you take the two minutes and thirty-eight seconds to understand it from Bezos' point of view, and to consider it for yourself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ"}]}

This particular program focused on the stock market and featured a classroom Q&A at Columbia University with Professor Benjamin Graham. Graham, often called \"the father of value investing\", is best known as Warren Buffet's mentor and author of the book, _The Intelligent Investor_. I have transcribed the three quotes that I found most interesting below in case you are not interested in watching 1950's black and white programming hosted by a man with a cigarette in hand and interrupted by commercials from The Aluminum Company of America.\n\nBenjamin Graham on dollar cost averaging (the strategy of investing a set amount of money in an asset at regular time intervals to neutralize short-term fluctuations in the price, a strategy which I am presently employing with Bitcoin and would consider for stock purchasing in the future):\n\n_\"I think there’s no doubt accepting your premise that a man who would put the same amount of money in the market year after year for the next 20 years let’s say has a very good chance of coming out ahead regardless of when he begins and particularly regardless of whether he should begin now. You have to allow for the human nature factor that no man can really say definitely just how he is going to behave over the next 10 or 20 years and there is danger that people who start with the idea of being systematic investors over the next 10 or 20 years may change their attitude as the market fluctuates and, in the first instance, put more money into the market because they become speculators, and secondly, get disgusted and scared and don’t buy at all later on when prices get low. It’s a psychological danger. The fault is not in the stars or the system but in ourselves I think.\"_\n\nBenjamin Graham on why the predictions of Wall Street experts are not more dependable:\n\n_\"Everybody on Wall Street is so smart that their brilliance offsets each other, and that whatever they know is already reflected in the level of the stock prices pretty much and consequently what happens in the future represents what they don't know.\"_\n\nEdward Murrow in closing the program:\n\n_\"[The stock exchange] remains the subject of curiosity and concern as to whether what is good for the exchange is good for the country and the people who live here. There have been no official charges that it has been rigged or manipulated but rather the question of whether or not the market is healthy. There is wide disagreement amongst the experts as to why the market behaves as it does but there is considerable agreement that it behaves the way it does because people behave the way they do. Good night and good luck.\"_"}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Think Big. Be Unique. Play All Day.\n\nI have been doing a lot of thinking lately. I do not have a full-time job, nor any real urgency to get one. So, I find myself in a fortunate position where I have sole control over how I spend most of my time.\n\nThe questions that I'm thinking about lately revolve around how I want to spend my days and what I want to do with my life. I think these questions are worth thinking a lot about. After all, time is the scarcest resource we all have. So what will I do with mine? What will I do with my days, weeks, months, years, and life? Those are the questions that I like to think about.\n\nFundamentally, I want to live a life well-lived. If I could have a moment to look back just before I die, I'd like to think that I really lived -- that I did life right, not according to anyone else's definition, but according to my own. I'd like to have done some things that felt good and meaningful, and to have enjoyed the ride. That is why I try to do both [the things that I want to do and the things I'll be glad I did](https://blogofjake.com/2020/08/17/the-things-you-want-to-do-and-the-things-youll-be-glad-you-did/).\n\nI want to be happy, sure, but more than that, I want to be great. I want to inch closer and closer to my potential. There's an unattributed quote that says something like, \"the definition of hell is, on your last day on earth, you meet the person you could have been.\" I'd like to meet that person and be uncertain as to whether they lived their life any better than I did at all. Maybe that's heaven.\n\nRecently, a few concepts have been re-occurring in my head fairly relentlessly. I am thinking that is probably because they are really important. The super summarized takeaways from each are as follows:\n\n  1. Think Big\n\n  2. Be Unique\n\n  3. Play All Day\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a bit more detail on each including quotes from others and summaries of my interpretations.\n\n### **Think Big**.\n\n> One thing about business that people don’t realize: it takes just as much effort to create a small business as it does to create a large one.\n> \n> Whether you’re Elon Musk or the guy running three Italian restaurants in town, you’re working 80 hours a week; you’re sweating bullets; you’re hiring and firing people; you’re trying to balance the books; it’s highly stressful; and it takes years and years of your life.\n> \n> In one case, you get companies worth $50-$100 billion and everyone’s adulation. In the other, you might make a little bit of money and you’ve got some nice restaurants. So think big.\n> \n> Naval Ravikant ([Source](https://nav.al/rich))\n\n> I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.\n> \n> If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.\n> \n> If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it.\n> \n> Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.\n> \n> Sam Altman ([Source](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful))\n\n> It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you\n> \n> It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason\n> \n> Nat Friedman ([Source](https://nat.org/))\n\nBig businesses are not _that_ much harder than small businesses. Big projects tend to be more exciting to work on, which makes them easier for you to work on, and more attractive to others who may be able to help. Considered together, big things may not be harder than small things at all, and the payoff is much greater. So, you might as well think big.\n\n### **Be Unique**.\n\n> The key thing to develop over time is, what are you going to be incredibly awesome at? There’s a great quote I discovered reading a Pat Riley book 20 years ago where he’s quoting Jerry Garcia from The Grateful Dead. He says \"you don’t want to be the best at what you do, you want to be the only one who does what you do.\" You want to develop strengths that are unique or world-class over time that become your competitive advantage and you want double down on those as much as possible and find companies and roles that leverage them to your maximum potential.\n> \n> Keith Rabois ([Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/omaidhomayun/2016/10/22/how-to-be-incredibly-awesome-at-what-you-do-an-interview-with-tech-titan-keith-rabois/?sh=73c7e8404406))\n\n> Don't aim to be the best. Be the only. That's a very high bar because it requires a tremendous amount of self-knowledge and awareness to get to that point to really understand what it is that you do better than anyone else in the world. And for most of us, it takes all of our lives to figure that out. And we also by the way need family, friends, colleagues, customers, clients, everyone around us to help us understand what it is that we do better than anyone else, because you can't really get there by yourself. You can't do \"thinkism\". You can't think your way there. You have to try to live it out and that's why most people's remarkable lives are full of detours and dead ends and right turns, because it's a very high bar, but if you can get there, you don't need a resume, there's no competition, and it's easy for you because you're doing it. You're not looking over your shoulder. You're just right there. So, don't aim to be the best. Be the only.\n> \n> Kevin Kelly ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ3Y_rjKvIE))\n\n> If you want an average successful life, it doesn’t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:\n> \n> 1\\. Become the best at one specific thing.  \n> 2\\. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.\n> \n> The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don’t recommend anyone even try.\n> \n> The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.\n> \n> Scott Adams ([Source](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html))\n\nYou don't just want to be the best at what you do. You want to be the only one who does what you do. Then you have no competition. You are the best by default. Find and combine your strengths and apply them together in a way that is completely unique. Then go all in on whatever that is. That will be your [personal](https://visualizevalue.com/blogs/feed/building-a-personal-monopoly) [monopoly](https://perell.com/note/build-a-personal-monopoly/). Incorporating the previous point, try to make it a big monopoly, but make sure it's still a monopoly.\n\n### **Play All Day**.\n\n> To this day, I don't enjoy working. I enjoy playing, and figuring out how to connect playing with business. To me, that's my niche. People talk about my work ethic as a player, but they don't understand. What appeared to be hard work to others was simply playing for me.\"\n> \n> Michael Jordan ([Source](https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Within-Michael-Jordan/dp/B000GYI1II))\n\n> What feels like play to you, but looks like work to others?\n> \n> Naval Ravikant ([Source](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1337144251403014144?s=20))\n\n> The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.\n> \n> Steve Jobs ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc))\n\nLastly, just play. Find something you love to do and just play all day. Play in a way that looks like work to others. You cannot work hard enough to beat the person who is playing because they can play longer than you can work. They can play all day every day. So you have to play. You have to love what you do. Loving what you do is a great end goal in and of itself, but it is also a means, the only means to doing great work. Relating the previous points, any area in which you play may be an area where you can be great. Combine a few of these areas to find something only you can do, to find your personal monopoly, then make it big.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn closing, let's consider these three principles in reverse order.\n\nFind what you love to do, what feels like play to you but looks like work to others. Consider which of those things you are strongest at and most likely will be able to develop further. These should be things that you love to do -- things that feel like play. If they were not, you would probably not be that strong at them. Once you have a list of those things, consider how you can combine two or a few of them in a way that seems like it could be big, while remaining unique.\n\nAsk yourself, how can you play your way to a massive personal monopoly? How can you become the only one who does what you do? These questions and quotes may help, but the answer is unlikely to be so formulaically findable. Like Kevin Kelly said, it may be the case that, \"You can't think your way there. You have to try to live it out.\" Personally, I don't think I've found my thing. In fact, I'm pretty darn sure I haven't.\n\nI didn't write this in hopes of doing so, but I do believe that with all this in mind, just for having written it, I will be better prepared to recognize once I've found it. Hopefully, that will allow me to go all in on the right thing once it appears. As a bonus, maybe this will help you too.\n\nThink big. Be unique. Play all day.\n\nThink big. Be unique. Play all day.\n\nThink big. Be unique. Play all day."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# The Things You Want To Do and The Things You’ll Be Glad You Did\n\nOne of the most fundamental questions I have considered in life is [whether it is better to do the things you want to do or the things you’ll be glad you did](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/06/running-in-the-winter-in-the-rain/). As with all questions, the answer is far from black and white. The question itself is inherently flawed. \n\nThat is because the question implies that:\n\n  * It is possible to identify things with certainty as objectively better or worse\n\n  * The things you want to do and the things you’ll be glad you did are mutually exclusive\n\n  * You can always know the things you’ll be glad you did before you do them\n\n\n\n\nNone of these are necessarily true and so I recognize this question I have considered is an imperfect one with an imperfect answer. Still, it has led me to the creation of a useful framework for thinking about what to do whenever there is any doubt.\n\nLet me begin by defining the two situations in which there is no doubt about what to do or not to do.\n\n  * When there is something that you want to do and you know or believe you will be glad you did later, you will generally do that thing without any hesitation.\n\n  * When there is something you do not want to do and you do not know or believe you will be glad you did later, you will generally not do that thing nor give it any further consideration.\n\n\n\n\nThe two situations described above represent opposite ends of the want to do / glad you did it spectrum in which both or neither of these primary reasons one would do something are satisfied. These situations are easy to navigate intuitively if not subconsciously so I will not waste another word on them herein.\n\nThe more interesting situations arise when the two reasons to do something (because you want to do it or will be glad you did) are either opposite or ambiguous. I would argue that there are 5 kinds of these situations in total. Those 5 kinds of situations are summarized as follows:\n\n  1. When you don’t want to do the thing but think you’ll be glad you did it. (i.e. exercise)\n\n  2. When you want to do the thing but think you’ll regret that you did it. (i.e. vices)\n\n  3. When you don’t know if you want to do the thing\n\n  4. When you don’t know if you’ll be glad you did the thing\n\n  5. When you don’t know if you want to do the thing or if you’ll be glad you did the thing\n\n\n\n\nMy proposition is that anything that one would consider doing should fall into one of these handful of buckets and that there are simple ways to approach these seemingly trickier situations once you identify which bucket they are in.\n\nIn the first instance, you should do the thing unless you really really don’t want to. Even then, sometimes you still should. You know you’ll be glad you did it.\n\nIn the second instance, you shouldn’t do the thing unless you really really want to. Even then, sometimes you still shouldn’t. You know you will regret it.\n\nIn next two instances which each involve one ambiguous aspect, decide based on the positivity or negativity of the other aspect (the unambiguous one).\n\nThe last instance may be the most common, especially for people who tend to dwell on the question of what to do. The strategic approach for what to do in this instance should come as a relief. In fact, it does not very much matter what you do in this double ambiguous instance. If you don’t know whether you want to do something or not and you don’t know whether you’ll be glad you did the thing or regret it, chances are you won’t be that glad or regretful either way, and if you don’t particularly want or not want to do it, then you don’t really care. It doesn’t really matter. The only wrong choice really is to dwell on this choice because you do not care about it and it does not matter. Just do it or don’t. \n\nAll but the last of the five scenarios described above end up looking like [70/30 decisions](https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/25/70-30-vs-51-49-decisions/). The last one seems more like a 51/49. With good judgment and a sound framework, [all of them can be made into quick and easy decisions about what to do or not to do](https://blogofjake.com/2020/07/23/how-to-make-more-good-decisions/).\n\nIdentify the bucket. Apply the approach. Just do it, or don’t."}]}

I had just finished a 3 mile run and it was the first thing I read on my phone. At first, I did not believe it. I googled it. It was true. I sat down on the pavement, shocked. I did not know what else to do.\n\nPeople talk about always remembering where they were when xyz happened. I never really understood that before, but I think this might have been one of those moments. Disbelief, shock, and sadness were felt all over the world yesterday by tens if not hundreds of millions of people I imagine. I cannot imagine the pain and devastation of those who actually knew Kobe, his daughter Gigi, or any of the other seven people who tragically died in yesterday's horrible and sickening accident. My sincere condolences to all of them, and to anyone else who is grieving today.\n\nAfter the news, I spent several hours watching ESPN and thumbing through Twitter to see the outpouring of emotions from people all over the world -- athletes, fans, presidents, friends, anyone, and, seemingly, everyone. More than ever, I appreciated Twitter as a medium on which the world could grieve together, where people who knew him best could share stories of what made him best.\n\nI tried to figure out why it was hitting me so hard and how I could react to the death of someone I never met with such shock and sadness. For the most part, I think it was a combination of two things.\n\nFirst, he was THE basketball player of my childhood. People argue frequently about who is the goat (greatest of all time). The debate usually is focused on Michael Jordan and LeBron, but forgetting all-time for a moment, from 2000 to 2010, from when I was 6 to 16 years old, it was all Kobe. For that decade, Kobe was the goat. His individual accolades only began with the fact that he was an All-Star all of those years, won an MVP, and two Finals MVPs. His teams won 5 championships in those 11 years. Kobe was a champion, a winner, an icon, and an idol.\n\nSecond, it was not what Kobe did but how he did it that was most inspiring. There were countless examples because it was the way he lived every day. Not flinching at Matt Barnes' pump fake at his head. Shooting the free throws after rupturing his achilles. Scoring 60 points in his final game. The stories of his work ethic. The things he would say to younger players. Kobe had a swagger about him that came naturally from his supreme confidence that was earned through relentless drive, discipline and hard work, the \"Mamba Mentality\" to get better every day at the game that he loved and the thing that he was most obsessed with for most of his life. His attitude was not just what made him great as a player. It was what made him so successful as a person, and such a compelling inspiration to the world. We saw what he did on the court throughout his nearly unparalleled career, but what saddens me most is what yesterday's tragedy robbed us of in terms of how much more he had left to offer the world, as demonstrated by the things he continued to do day in and day out.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Kobe was on a mission to share wisdom with people in a way that would make the world a better place. He wanted to continue to inspire people. After he retired, he wrote [books ](https://www.amazon.com/Kobe-Bryant-Book-Books/s?k=Kobe+Bryant+Book&rh=n%3A283155)and produced a [podcast series for kids](https://open.spotify.com/show/58Sf2th9RlOZC3cqsheVu8). He mentored young players (both male and female) in a self-described effort to help move the game forward. That is part of why his final [tweet ](https://twitter.com/kobebryant/status/1221276426164269056)congratulating LeBron on passing his third place spot on the all time scoring list is so difficult to read today.\n\nThinking about how I want to remember Kobe, and how I want to make my small individual contribution to carrying on his legacy, two things came to mind. First, I will strive to be a little more like Kobe. Second, I will help spread his wise words which serve as guides for how to do that, both through his own words and through my interpretations of them.\n\nOn that first point, this morning I ran 8 miles out of respect for Kobe because, as many of you know, that was one of his jersey numbers (his other number was 24 and I have not run more than 3 miles in one go in a couple of months so 8 was plenty challenging for me). I realized on my run that Kobe's numbers 24/8 seemed to describe his work ethic. It was as if he could somehow work a day more every week than everyone else could have done working 24/7. I also learned today that he chose the number 24 in large part as a reminder to take things one day at a time, and somewhat eerily, \"to live every day as if it was my last\". I listened to an awesome [podcast ](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kobe-bryant-on-how-to-be-strategic-obsessive-to-find/id1450994021?i=1000449110208)with Kobe for the first half of my run and part of a [second one](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kobe-bryant/id1452698284?i=1000450108225) (where the above quote about his number came from) until the last mile of my run when I took my headphones out just to focus on the running. I pushed myself hard on pace for short stretches of that last mile and when I was about a quarter mile from the finish a woman slowed her car and rolled her window down to ask me if I was okay. She said she had seen me earlier and that I did not look okay. At this point I was not pushing so hard and I was able to laugh and tell her I was good and thank her for checking on me. I was happy to know that I was pushing hard enough to look not okay enough for someone to stop and check on me. That had never happened to me before. I smiled for the rest of the run. Kobe probably got that all the time.\n\nIn terms of the second part about spreading Kobe's message, as with anything, the best time to begin is now. Below are some bits of wisdom I have gained just in the last 24 hours from clips that people have shared of him and the podcasts I listened to this morning.\n\n_\"I have no fear whatsoever. If I take the last second shot and miss, so what.\"_ ([ESPN](https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1221646388871626753)) Kobe did not fear failure. He embraced opportunity. He shot his shots, including the biggest shots in the biggest games. One of his earliest failures was in Game 5 versus the Jazz in the 1997 Western Conference Semifinals when Kobe shot 4 air-balls in 5 minutes. Those were the biggest shots in the final minutes of his team's biggest game of the year, and the biggest of his career to that point. He later said that he knew it was not the pressure that got to him but the lack of strength moving from 30 game high school seasons to 80+ game NBA schedules. He took the lesson from that failure that he needed to get stronger and 3 years later his team was winning championships. I believe that failure is a prerequisite for success. If you are not failing, you are not shooting the big shots. I want to shoot like Kobe.\n\n_\"Do not negotiate with yourself.\"_ ([1st podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kobe-bryant-on-how-to-be-strategic-obsessive-to-find/id1450994021?i=1000449110208)) Kobe said that when you tell yourself you are going to do something, you are signing a contract with yourself. You cannot negotiate after that. The contract is signed. You have to go do it. I too believe in doing what you say you are going to do, what you set out to do. I find myself negotiating with myself all the time but I will remember more often now not to.\n\n_\"I expected to win 8.\"_ ([1st podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kobe-bryant-on-how-to-be-strategic-obsessive-to-find/id1450994021?i=1000449110208)) Kobe was talking about his expectations for the number of championships he would win. He expected to win 8 but instead he won 5. He failed to meet his own expectations but he exceeded everyone else's with the 5 championships that helped make him an unequivocal success and one of the greatest basketball players of all time. I think eventually he probably came to view it all as a success as well, but the point is that sometimes success comes in the form of failing to meet one's high expectations for oneself while still coming close. The expectations need to be incredibly high if one wants to be great. Kobe came into the league as a 17-year-old kid telling people he was going to be the next Michael Jordan. Most people would say that he fell slightly short of that expectation for himself too, but no one would ever dare to call Kobe a failure. Kobe was one of the greatest of all time, I believe, because his expectations were to become the greatest of all time and because he knew the amount of work and dedication that he would have to put in to accomplish that expectation. He wanted to take the biggest shots there were to take. He did not negotiate with himself. He just did what he knew he needed to do every single day. He may have failed, but his coming close won him 5 NBA Championships and global recognition as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.\n\nFinally, for anyone facing the the question of how to move forward from this and/or future tragedies, we may find the way forward through the [wise words of none other than Kobe himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je1O9Q47ql0), as copied below:\n\n_\"Have a good time. Enjoy life. Life is too short to get bogged down and be discouraged. You have to keep moving. You have to keep going. Put one foot in front of the other, smile, and just keep on rolling.\"_\n\nRest in peace to Gigi and the rest of those passengers who are gone now far too soon.\n\nRest in peace, Kobe. Thank you, and much respect."}]}

Sure enough, it does. Below are the two charts together. The darker line shows the price according to the left-side axis and the lighter line shows the Google Trends Score according to the right-side axis.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edff057-e63d-44f2-a2d4-5d250c4af613_783x306.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3edff057-e63d-44f2-a2d4-5d250c4af613_783x306.png)\n\nIt turns out that bitcoin's price and its Google Trends Score are quite correlated.\n\nSpecifically, they have had a 72% positive correlation since October 2013. This compares favorably to bitcoin's [26% correlation with the stock market and 24% correlation with gold](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-is-weakening-says-new-kraken-report) over the last year.\n\nI should note that the correlation between bitcoin's price and its Google Trends Score was much stronger up until both price and score peaked in December 2017 (98%) than it has been since (59%).\n\nNonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is not to argue about the level of correlation nor to assert causation one way or another (though it seems logical that the price and popularity feed off of each other). Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to make a speculative projection regarding what bitcoin's price could be if and when its popularity (as measured by its Google Trends Score) returns to and surpasses its previous all-time high.\n\nIn order to make this projection, we first must consider the historical ratio between bitcoin's average price and its Google Trends Score on a monthly basis. Let us refer to this as the _**price:score ratio**_**** for short.\n\n**Bitcoin's Price:Score Ratio**\n\nThe chart below shows how bitcoin's price:score ratio has increased over the last several years.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7da57fc5-92bf-4887-a8ea-727ed4c52374_783x307.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7da57fc5-92bf-4887-a8ea-727ed4c52374_783x307.png)\n\nFor a ratio that has been relatively volatile historically, it has remained unusually consistent for the last two months (June & July) at 729, just 4% short of its all-time high of 758 in November 2019.\n\nBitcoin's price:score ratio has been above 645 for 9 of the last 12 months after having only reached such a level once before, and barely (646 in October 2018).\n\nThe 3 months in the last year during which the ratio was lower than 645 can be fairly easily explained. They took place this past March, April, and May as hype grew in anticipation of bitcoin's once every four years halving event on May 11, 2020. Additionally, people perhaps were searching more than usual for information about alternative assets (including bitcoin) when the stock market crashed ~30% in the early days of the lockdown resulting from the pandemic. Those two factors together seem sufficient to explain the uptick in bitcoin's Google Trends Score over that period. On the other side of the price:score ratio, bitcoin's price fell along with the market, and so with the price going down and the score going up, the decreased price:score ratio over those few months makes sense.\n\nSince the stock market substantially recovered and the halving event came and went without materially moving bitcoin's price, the Google Trends Score has returned to the pre-pandemic, pre-halving-hype range. For the last two months (June & July), bitcoin's monthly Google Trends Score has stayed steady at 13, which is equal to its average from April 2018 (after the peak) through February 2020 (before the halving hype and market crash).\n\nFor some additional context, it should be noted that bitcoin's Google Trends Score has only been equal to or greater than 21 in 7 months since bitcoin's inception and they all took place consecutively surrounding bitcoin's last major surge from September 2017 through March 2018 (with scores chronologically of 21, 22, 44, 100, 55, 39, and 23).\n\n**Flying Under The Radar**\n\nSufficed to say, bitcoin's average score of 13 since the last surge, excluding the three aforementioned months from earlier this year (14 if we include them), shows objectively that bitcoin is flying under the radar (in terms of its popularity as a search term at least). Of course, it may not seem this way to people who follow crypto closely and daily but the algorithmic and mass-data collecting Google Trends Score should be trusted over any single person's speculative and subjective observation about the current level of hype and attention.\n\nIf you, like me, believe that bitcoin is and has been flying under the radar for more than two years now, the natural question to ask is this. What do we expect to happen when that is no longer the case? In other words, what happens to bitcoin's price if and when it reaches the pinnacle of its next hype cycle? How high might bitcoin fly the next time we see a situation similar to that of December 2017?\n\n**Projecting Bitcoin's Price**\n\nI believe a reasonable response to this question can be made by applying bitcoin's average price:score ratio over the last twelve months (643) to a Google Trends Score of 100 to estimate what bitcoin's price would be if the price:score ratio stays about constant and bitcoin's popularity in terms of search returns to its all-time high. The price implied by this projection is about $65,000 as is demonstrated by the maximum value in the top right corner of the chart below. Basically, if one believes that bitcoin will at least at some point return to the level of popularity it attained in December 2017, this methodology would lead that person to expect bitcoin to attain a price of at least $60,000 at that time.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffed131e9-745d-4e3e-8639-bee1217db7ba_783x308.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffed131e9-745d-4e3e-8639-bee1217db7ba_783x308.png)\n\nThis estimate can be made less conservative in two ways. The first is to assume that the price:score ratio will continue to increase as it has all along (6% month-over-month), rather than calculating the price using the LTM average of the ratio. The second is to assume that bitcoin's popularity as a search term will well surpass its previous all-time high set in December 2017 just as that all-time was more than twice as great as any high before it and more than 8 times greater than the all-time high before May 2017 (which was set in December 2013, perhaps not coincidentally exactly 4 years or one halving period prior to the latest all-time high). I hesitate to call either of these two less conservative assumptions aggressive because they are not only reasonable but actually probable if one is to simply assume that the historical trends will continue in terms of the score and the ratio.\n\nAs such, I will close by presenting a chart which one can use to approximate the price implied by their own inputs for the Google Trends Score and the price:score ratio. In this chart, I show the ratio for the last 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and so on, and use the average year-over-year growth rate between those figures (16%) to project the next twelve months (\"NTM\"), next two years (\"N2Y\"), and next three years (\"N3Y\") ratios.\n\nThe highest price projected on the chart is right around $300,000 based on a Google Trends Score of 3 times the previous all-time high (300) and a projected N3Y price:score ratio of 996 (the LTM average of 643 increased 16% 3 times for 3 years). Of course, this maximum price projection is limited only arbitrarily by the maximums I have decided to present on this chart for both the score and the ratio.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca7131e2-79f5-445b-afed-cae432c0dbce_783x306.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca7131e2-79f5-445b-afed-cae432c0dbce_783x306.png)\n\n**To Be Continued...**\n\nMany people have employed many methodologies in attempting to accurately project bitcoin's price. For example, [PlanB](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD)'s stock to flow ratio looks at scarcity to make one of the more convincing price projections I've seen. My price:score ratio looks at popularity in endeavoring to do the same. This analysis was not intended to be totally comprehensive. My intention was merely to introduce this methodology for others to critique. As such, my hope is that this becomes widely enough read so that I may receive ample critical feedback for further consideration and refinement of the methodology.\n\n_As always, I welcome all outreach to jake@blogofjake.com and any comments on Twitter[@blogofjake](https://twitter.com/blogofjake)_"}]}

I felt physically fatigued, mentally foggy, and had a slightly sore throat. I did not know if I was sick or simply worn out from running 15 miles on Sunday, lifting on Monday, and moving out of my New York City apartment on Tuesday. The apartment was a 5th floor walk-up and my brother and I must have made at least 30 round-trips up and down the stairs from the apartment to our rented U-Haul. We wore masks and gloves all day from the moment we picked up the truck to when we got home after returning it. I ran 3 miles after that as well.\n\nWednesday is usually the one day of the week that I lift weights and run, but this Wednesday I was not feeling up for either. I decided soon after waking up that I would give myself a sick day and take the day off from both. Some people think they are so tough by not taking sick days when they are not feeling well. They fail to realize that nine times out of ten their boss will get over it and everything will be fine. They pretend they are persevering because they are tough but really they lack confidence in themselves and their value. They fear the blow to their reputation they envision enduring if they show what they believe will be perceived as a sign of weakness. They want to feel needed, but no one is going to die if they miss a day. I might make an exception for a surgeon.\n\nAnyway, I am my own boss right now, and though I may be less forgiving to myself than most bosses are to their employees, I knew I needed to give myself the day. I spent all day Wednesday resting, relaxing, hydrating, and eating. I gave myself the day off of my usual [weekday diet](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/21/the-gluten-free-vegan-diet-intermittent-fasting-and-green-smoothies/) as well. I had oatmeal and toast, a can of Italian wedding soup, pasta and chicken fingers.\n\nTaking care of myself on Wednesday proved to be the move on Thursday when I woke up feeling much better and back to my normal self. It is rare that I go from feeling so poor to so fine in 24 hours but I am hopeful that it might have been a result of all of the things I have been doing this year to improve my health. Still, feeling fine I was now faced with the challenge of resuming my exercise habit as well as my weekday diet. I knew it was important after missing a day to pick it back up as soon as I could. I knew if I did not, I ran the risk of letting myself sink into a new habit of missing. If that went on for long enough, I would potentially have to build back my habits from scratch. I did not want to have to do that. It is much easier to keep doing than to start doing.\n\nHabits are always on my mind but even more than usual lately as I have been reading James Clear's book _Atomic Habits_ , which is excellent by the way. To avoid losing a habit and having to start from scratch, James suggests the simple rule of never missing twice in a row. I think this is a fine rule most of the time but if you have the flu or something else that is fairly debilitating, not missing twice can counterproductive to recovery. That is why I consider the generally good advice of not missing twice to be more useful only in combination with another piece of habit-building advice which ensures that if you do have to miss twice, it is not over. Simply begin again.\n\nI learned the phrase \"simply begin again\" from a [venture capitalist](https://feld.com/archives/2019/12/bfeld-v54-0.html) and a [teacher of meditation](https://insighttimer.com/josephgoldstein/guided-meditations/simply-begin-again). Thursday, I remembered it and put it to good use. I woke up, ran 5 miles, and resumed my weekday diet with a smoothie around noon. Just like that, I was back. This time, I did not need to miss twice. One day, I will. As soon as I am reasonably able, I will simply begin again."}]}

My predictions that Warren would lose voter share to Sanders, that Buttigieg appeared to be outperforming Biden, and that Bloomberg and Yang should be included on the debate stage have all since come to fruition. Other takes such as that the network should start the debate an hour earlier and that Bernie should announce Tulsi as his running mate have not come true. Well, not yet anyway.\n\nNonetheless, I enjoy following politics despite the frustration that it often produces. I like to consider how I think the future will unfold based on the latest state of play, as I do with most everything that I pay attention to in life. My best prediction of this election thus far came on October 23rd when I predicted by Judge Judy’s seemingly random endorsement that Mike Bloomberg would be a top 3 front-runner for President.\n\nBloomberg officially announced his candidacy a month and a day later on November 24th and he is now widely recognized as a top 2-3 contender with as good a shot to win as anybody.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg's debate last night has been considered an epic failure by virtually everyone I have seen comment on it, from CNN to Fox News and from the general Twitterverse to its most powerful and controversial tweeter, @realDonaldTrump. The words \"crushed\", \"pummeled\", \"disastrous\", and even \"[worst in the history of debates](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1230376522663391232)\" have been uttered by a host of people who seem to believe that Bloomberg could not have done worse last night. I do not very much like it when everyone agrees and fails to consider an opposite perspective so naturally I am going to take the contrarian view that this debate will in fact serve to help Bloomberg's chances of winning the nomination/presidency. To be clear, I am not arguing that he will necessarily win either (although I do believe he has the best chance of becoming our next president besides Trump) but rather, my argument is simply that last night's debate will prove to be a net positive for Bloomberg, and that it will in fact help his overall chances. This would be evidenced by his forward performance in comparison with current expectations which are broadly that he will fail to win the Democratic nomination, let alone the presidency.\n\nFirst, there is a famous quote that is wrongly attributed to Ghandi which says, \"first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\" That is exactly how it went for Trump. That is sort of how things are going for Bernie, but not nearly as much as it is for Bloomberg. Heading into last night's debate, most of the political experts as well as the results of the first two states that voted (though not necessarily representative of the country) have favored Bernie to win the Democratic nomination, at least in term of having the most total delegates prior to the convention at which point it is most likely that still none of the Democratic Candidates will have a majority to clinch nomination. Despite Bernie being the overwhelmingly clear favorite at this point, the candidates last night either did not believe that or did not at all act like it. As a competitor in a game in which there will be only one winner, it would seem obvious that everyone should fight to take down the leader. That is why it was strange that hardly anyone fought Bernie at all last night, but everyone fought Bloomberg. A far worse outcome for Bloomberg in last night's debate in my opinion would have been if he showed up to his first debate and was a complete non-factor. If all of the other candidates treated Bloomberg like Steyer (no offense to the less wealthy billionaire), I think it would have raised a lot more red flags for Bloomberg's supporters and potential future supporters. Instead, the divided field of candidates which has democrat voters struggling to find a horse they believe in enough to unite behind in a race against Trump decided to attack the horse that has gained surprisingly (to most) strong momentum thus far on a narrative that is more than anything dependent on an argument that he is the most capable of beating Trump in the upcoming election. It seemed to me that the other candidates' apparent fear of Bloomberg which drove them to attack him incomparably more than Bernie, who is literally winning, established Bloomberg as the leader of the field.\n\nSecond, the vast majority of attacks on Bloomberg were focused on two subjects and they were not raised only by the candidates themselves. The moderators' first two questions directed to Bloomberg were about the controversial \"stop and frisk\" program he instituted as Mayor of New York and about the accusations that women have made about certain things that he has said in the workplace. The candidates honed in hard on these issues and basically accused Bloomberg of being a racist and a sexist. His defenses in response to these accusations may not have been strong or even satisfactory according to most, but the accusations themselves were not new and as such I do not envision them changing the opinions of too many people who supported Bloomberg heading into last night's debate or too many people who were and would still be open to moving their support over to his campaign. The attacks on Bloomberg rarely focused on policy or challenged his important and most critical claims that he is the best suited to beat Trump and the most qualified to run the country. If the attacks remain limited to calling him a racist and a sexist, I think there is a group people who have already dismissed him because of those accusations and there is a larger group of people who have not and I do not envision very many people on either side changing their minds in the absence of new and material evidence that paints a worse picture of his character than has already been fairly or unfairly painted.\n\nThird and finally, before last night's debate, Bloomberg's chances of picking up more than exactly zero delegates in the Nevada caucuses this weekend were zero percent, given that he will not be on the ballot until Super Tuesday on March 3rd. Regardless of his performance last night, his chances of picking up a delegate or more in Nevada were always going to be zero, so besides a possible non-results based reversal of momentum, he had nothing to lose between now and next Tuesday's debate which is still a few days before the final primary in South Carolina where he will still be ineligible to win any delegates. The next debate will also be a solid week before Super Tuesday when it will be absolutely critical for him to perform well in aggregate with the 14 states and 1 US territory that will be casting their votes. In high school, someone told me that in the eyes of college admissions offices, applicants who improved their high school grades from low B's to high A's look as if not more impressive compared to those who had high A's the whole way through. Whether this is true or not is not necessarily important, but I do believe that people like to get on board with things that appear to be on an upwards trajectory, whether they are students with improving academics, companies with improving financials, or candidates with improving debate performances. In last night's debate, which has less than half of the days (6) until the next one compared with any other Democratic Debate that has been held or is on the schedule, Bloomberg took the heat, and in the media's mind, he got smoked. The reviews have been brutal, and you can join the masses and view that as a big negative but I see a golden opportunity that would not have been possible without last night's performance. The golden opportunity is for Bloomberg to go out on the debate stage next Tuesday in South Carolina and blow everyone away with a strong and now unexpected performance. If he had 14 points to allocate on these two debates to be rated out of ten, I would have used 5 last night and 9 next Tuesday, and that is what I think he has an amazing opportunity to do if he can pull it off. Bloomberg has been a long shot from the beginning, just like our current president was, but his momentum has grown and grown in the polls and there will be very few if any conducted between this debate and the next one to show a reversal in that momentum, if there in fact has been one. A very strong performance following what was considered a very weak one may be just what this long shot needs to have a real shot to win the nomination and the presidency. One thing is for sure. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out."}]}

I think it is because I was only first introduced to the non-on/off type of light switch relatively later on in my childhood. It must have been in a hotel or somewhere cool that led me to associate it this way, and we have a few in our family home which we moved to when I was in the 5th grade, so it must have been sometime before then that I first used one. Regardless, it seems preferable to me to have options between having the lights all the way on or all the way off, so I have always enjoyed that opportunity as it is afforded by the dimmer.\n\nIt seems intuitive to me that most people are like me in that they enjoy the opportunity to have options between two extremes. If you put 100 people in a room with an on/off light switch and asked them to vote their preference, you would force people to choose an extreme and end up with a majority voting to have the light either on or off, and the outcome would be based on majority rule. If those same 100 people in that same room, however, had a dimmer, they could vote in a variety of ways for a variety of options and the consensus outcome could be to have the lights at any level in between off and on. It seems likely that more people would be more pleased with the outcome that way.\n\nThe real world works more like the room with the dimmer. We have complex means by which outcomes are selected and people's preferences exist all over the spectrum. There are people at both extremes who believe we should have the lights all the way on or all the way off, but the vast majority of people see that the best solution lies somewhere in the middle. In an effective voting system, that is where the outcome would land. It would change gradually over time as the people would be conscious to move slowly enough not to trip any unforeseen adverse effects that may be experienced by moving too quickly along the path of attempted progress. Along the way, there would be regressions in the opposite direction too of course, likely in the form of reactions to those unforeseen adverse effects that despite general caution would inevitably be triggered.\n\nIn the real world, the tug of wars between extreme progress and the status quo, anchored by entrenched interests and pulled the other way by extreme regress, rage on for every issue across the board, and the ribbons on the ropes representing the current statuses of the issues lie somewhere in between extremes, with both sides tugging at the rope until they cross the threshold and win the war. The war is won when the middle has been pulled far enough to one side that the old extreme becomes the new norm, and a new war has formed. This does not happen overnight. It happens over the course of weeks, months, years, decades, and centuries, even millenia. The time it takes to resolve depends on the power and the reach of the impact of the issue. A battle over local library hours in a small township, for example, will not last nearly as long as the ongoing battle between science and religion.\n\nFor the sake of the comparison I am about to make, let us now disassociate the traditional positivity and newness associated with light and the corresponding negativity and oldness associated with dark. Let us instead assume that the light room represents the old world and the dark room represents the new world. By definition, if the dark room is the new world and the light room is the old world, we are as a matter of fact transitioning from the light room to the dark room. The only question is how we will get there, and at what speed. If we are in the room with the dimmer, the transition can happen at any rate over any period of time depending on how the people in the room see fit, but the room will eventually be dark, and they will have arrived in the new world that many had long envisioned. If, however, we are in the room with only an on/off switch, the lights must turn off at some individual instant. In that case, the people's eyes will not have the luxury of being able to adjust over time. They will at first be shocked and almost entirely unable to see, but just for a moment before their eyes will quickly adjust, as eyes always do, and as humans always do. The transition is more sudden and instantaneously scarier without the dimmer, but it is quicker with the on/off switch, and it forces us to adjust faster.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the world has figuratively turned off the lights. The people are in shock, but they are quickly adjusting. And the good news for those who don't is that we will soon return to some form of light. Many already realize that it is impractical to stay in the dark. We are not ready for it yet, and too many people will suffer. Most agreed that we needed to turn the lights out for a bit because it became predictable that too many people were going to die in the light. We turned the lights off to give ourselves some time to see how those predictions played out and to figure out a better way to operate with the lights on, and as we figure that out, or as the dark begins to threaten more livelihoods than the light does lives, we will use the dimmer to bring back some unknown level of light at some unpredictable speed.\n\nIt is important to recognize, however, that even if we could go back to the same level of light as before (i.e. if an extremely successful vaccine was discovered, produced and made available in limitless quantities starting tomorrow), even then, the room still will have changed.\n\nIt will have changed because the people in it will have now lived in the dark and many of them will have already adjusted to it. Everyday the lights stay off, more and more people are seeing the future in the dark. Many of them will not go back to many of the ways they used to live in the light. New world inevitabilities like decentralized systems of money, remote work, and online education have now been tested by necessity rather than curiosity and the transitions in their directions will be accelerated by this momentary turning off of the lights.\n\nThe winners in this new world will be determined as in most cases by a combination of preparedness and luck. They will be those who saw certain aspects of what the new world looked like and acted fast enough to position themselves properly before the lights went out. Those people must now feel like Muhammad Ali, not just because they are winners, but because they were \"in bed before the room was dark\".\n\nI have seen many people suggest that the way we are living now is the new normal. It is not. On the other side, I have seen many people suggest that the world will go back to the way it used to be. It will not. It never does."}]}

In total, over the last several months since I started writing, the blog has been read by people in 92 different countries. Below is the map of what that looks like. If you have a friend in Greenland, send it their way. I am trying to paint the world pink.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc643aea2-e476-45ac-9750-29b0417d9580_1024x513.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc643aea2-e476-45ac-9750-29b0417d9580_1024x513.png)\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call  _The Weekend Miscellaneous_.\n\n_17 miles_ \\- I ran 17 miles on Sunday. I am now well into uncharted territory. In my first 25 years, I had run one half-marathon on a morning of sheer will and determination. Besides that, I had only run further than 3 miles a handful of times. My second longest run was 5 miles, which was why the half marathon was so crazy at the time. Now, on 3 of the last 5 Sundays, I have run a half marathon, 15 miles, and 17 miles. I am probably going to run a marathon soon. I feel so fortunate not to have had any injuries throughout all of this running (knocking on wood as I write this). It is good to be 25.\n\n_Banana bag_ \\- For the long runs recently, I have brought along with me a bottle of[ this drink that I like called Roar](https://www.target.com/p/roar-organic-georgia-peach-electrolyte-infusions-18-fl-oz/-/A-53305982). I like the Georgia Peach flavor. For the 17 mile run this weekend, I figured I should bring a snack too. I looked up what was recommended and ended up pocketing a small ziploc bag with a banana broken into quarters and a handful of raisins as well. I cracked open the bag around the 9 or 10 mile mark to have my snack on the run. The 4 pieces of banana had held their form relatively well in my pocket but had definitely changed a little bit. They looked almost caramelized as if they were ready to be served as part of a banana foster. Most of the raisins seemed to have selected one of the 4 chunks of banana to stick with. I popped the first piece. It was delicious. I had no idea this concoction had been slow-cooking in my pocket by means of consistent motion and body heat. The good news is that I discovered a surprisingly tasty snack. The bad news is that it takes a tremendous amount of time and effort to prepare. The official recipe is to cut a banana into four pieces, put that in a ziploc bag with a handful of raisins, put the bag in your pocket, and run ten miles in 70 or 80 degree heat. Enjoy.\n\n_Ferriss & Naval _\\- I listened to a[ ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1yTaZvBKLTwVQHcNTvZ19i?si=6bIfLhx9TVu1RKqwQO66yQ)podcast during my run as usual. This was a great one. It was a two-hour [conversation between Tim Ferriss and Naval Ravikant](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1yTaZvBKLTwVQHcNTvZ19i?si=6bIfLhx9TVu1RKqwQO66yQ), two people who have influenced me a lot through things they have written and said. They talk about everything from morning routines and identifying great founders to their favorite books and how to read them. At one point, Naval talks about how he became a healthier eater simply by getting a teppanyaki grill. He says the freshness of eating meats and vegetables just seconds removed from the grill is as enjoyable as any of the unhealthier foods he used to enjoy instead. Humans evolved eating around the fire cooking food bite by bite. It is instinctually pleasant. I had a couple great experiences eating out at places with teppanyaki grills with my buddy Eric in Japan. I am thinking about getting one now myself.\n\n_Mr. Feynman_ \\- On the podcast, Tim & Naval talked about their mutual admiration for the famed physicist, Richard Feynman. I had started his book _Six Easy Pieces_ several weeks ago but never got past the first few chapters. I think I will revisit it at some point, but first I want to check out _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_. It sounds more biographical than physics-focused. Last night, I watched [this 50 minute interview with Mr. Feynman called ](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6ptg1x)_[The Pleasure of Finding Things Out](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6ptg1x)_. I gathered from the chapters I read of his book that he must have been an extraordinary teacher and this video goes to show that. He talks about how he picked it up from the way his father taught him when he was young. He talks about the importance of treating work like play, the concept of \"active irresponsibility\", and the difference between saying one knows something and legitimately knowing something. Mr. Feynman seems like an exceptionally curious character and I look forward to learning more about him and his teachings of physics and otherwise."}]}

I first became intrigued by the concept of minimalism years ago after watching [a documentary called ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrzESek2B2E)_[Minimalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrzESek2B2E)_. It was oddly inspiring.\n\nBy the next day, I had cleaned out my closet and filled a few trash bags with clothes for donation. A few things were in bad enough shape that I trashed them. Suddenly, it seemed so stupid that I still kept one of my favorite shirts from high school even though it had a stain on it. Probably pasta oil.\n\nMy methodology for getting ridding of clothes was simple. I made 3 piles. The first was for my favorite things. I knew them well because I wore them often. The second was for the things that I sort of liked or liked a lot but hardly wore. That was the \"maybe\" pile. I took that pile and stored those clothes away and out of sight so that if I thought of something I wanted from it in the next few months, I could go and get it. I might have gone back for one or two things but most of it ended up in the same place as the third pile, Goodwill or the garbage.\n\nI enjoyed my cleaner closet, and for a while, that was the only thing I minimalized. Later, I started getting rid of some more stuff. I had a ton of things that I did not need or use and was not particularly fond of. I did not dislike these things, but I did not particularly like them either. How much can one really love a pencil sharpener on their desk when they haven't used a pencil since high school anyway? And why did I need any pencils, or seventeen pens? I got rid of some things.\n\nA year or two later, I shifted the minimalist perspective to my phone. I deleted all of the apps that I had not used that week, plus a few that I did use but did not want to be using so much. I added them back more thoughtfully as needed over time and only kept a handful of apps on the first screen. I could always swipe over to get to the rest of them, but there was no reason to have the App Store in my face every time I opened my phone when I only needed to download a new app one time in every few thousand uses probably, if that.\n\nGetting rid of non-essential things that I did not explicitly enjoy allowed me to more easily see the things I did like and the surprisingly limited number of things I did need. I did not have nearly as many things to take care of, worry about, put away, clean up, pick up, pack up, or move. As an example of that, I lived in San Francisco for about a year and a half and was able to live in four different places in a few different parts of town because moving my limited possessions was so quick and easy and cheap. I only had to splurge on an Uber XL because of my mattress. When I moved back to New York, I left my mattress behind and moved everything I had with two checked bags and a carry-on. All I had to do was get on the plane. The mobility that is enabled by minimalism is a wonderful type of freedom. That is only one of the many benefits that I have found.\n\nOver time, minimalism has brought me to a place where I have begun to view all of life through a minimalist lens in a way. I have applied it to my subscriptions, my activities, and even my beliefs. Minimalism is not just about getting rid of things. It is about seeing more clearly [what you need](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/31/the-eleven-human-needs/) and what you love and gaining appreciation for those things.\n\nLess is more, if you appreciate it as such."}]}

In 1859, a man by the name of Thomas Austin is purported to have released 24 of them to the wild for hunting purposes, and it is believed that his small release originated the infestation that exists today.\n\nOver the last 150 years or so, rabbits have absolutely dominated the Australian ecosystem, leading to the extinction of many native species and wreaking havoc on the land and the human population’s ability to farm it. In America, bunnies are cute. In Australia, they are pests.\n\nIn an attempt to take their land back from the bunnies, Australians have released deadly diseases to the rabbit population, once killing over 90%. They have introduced predators of the rabbit, built fences to contain them and hunted aggressively, but to no avail. The rabbits took over too quickly and reproduced to a level of prevalence too powerful to reverse. The rabbits have persisted and arguably grown stronger now than ever, not in numbers, but in the strength of their resistance.\n\nThe rabbits’ conquer of Australia shows how critical the conditions of an environment are to enabling something new to dominate. Rabbits never came close to dominating Europe, but they almost instantaneously took over Australia due to the near perfect conditions that the environment offered. Once the rabbit dominated the continent, it became very difficult for any similar species, even if it was better in some ways, to be introduced to compete with the rabbit, let alone thrive. The rabbits reproduced exponentially faster than any new species due to their already massive population and they had generational experience on the land as well as a long history of resisting the greatest of attacks on their kind.\n\nIn the 21st century, rabbits are built by software. They are technology companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, and AirBnB. Even Bitcoin is a rabbit. These were not necessarily the first movers in their respective categories, but rather, the first to be introduced to the right environment where they could thrive and grow quickly to dominate. Once the bread grows mold, it quickly spreads. The goliaths of tech have become more powerful largely as a result of their network effects, but the critical mass was achieved by introducing a good product in the right environment at the right time.\n\nIt will not be easy to kill the rabbits."}]}

If you have an opinion on Elon but have not taken the time to listen to him speak, I encourage you to either drop your opinion or take the time to listen to him speak. Far too many people these days develop opinions on people they do not know at all. These opinions are formed from headlines, tweets, and the opinions of other people who also do not know the person they have formed their opinions on. Podcasts, blogs, and books are better. Many understand Elon is extraordinarily smart. Having read his biography and listened to him speak for at least 5 hours worth of podcasts, I believe Elon is an extraordinarily good person too.\n\nIn his conversation with Joe, Elon discussed the concept of \"life years\". Joe mentioned he had read something that suggested the average person who died from COVID-19 would have lived another 10 years had they not died of COVID-19. Elon said this number sounded much too high. For now, let us take it for what it is, however, I imagine it is more likely to be accurate or high than it is to be low. Early reports from China said the average age of death was [75](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?utm_campaign=homeAdvegas1?%22) and recent reports from Pennsylvania said it was [79](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/pennsylvania-covid-19-deaths-average-79-and-67-occurred-nursing-homes). Both of these numbers are higher than the global average lifespan of [71 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy)years. That does not look like a decade of life lost per person, but the data is not nearly as good as I would like it to be, so I will give the 10 year estimate the benefit of the doubt. Multiply that 10 years per person by the [289,000](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) COVID-19 deaths reported worldwide and you get a product of 2.89 million life years lost as a result of COVID-19 so far this year. This is an inconceivably terrible number to be sure, but less so than the numbers I am about to introduce as they relate to children-under-5 mortality.\n\nFor every COVID-19 death this year, approximately 10 children under 5 years old have died ([2.76 million](https://www.worldometers.info/)). Over-conservatively assuming a death age of 4 combined with the lowest national average life expectancy in the world ([52](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264719/ranking-of-the-20-countries-with-the-lowest-life-expectancy/) in Sierra Leone), that equals 48 years lost per life. Multiply that 48 years per person by the 2.76 million lives that have been lost of children under 5 this year and you get a product of 132.48 million. That means for every 1 life year lost to COVID-19 this year, 45 life years are lost to deaths of children under 5. It is worth reiterating how intentionally over-conservative my assumptions were. The real ratio could easily be greater than 100 to 1. If only we focused on preventing these deaths of children under 5 half as much as we have focused on preventing deaths from COVID-19. We could save a lot of lives, and many more healthy life years.\n\nAdditionally, children-under-5 mortality seems to be a much more quantifiable problem to solve. We can save lives for known costs as opposed to the unknown consequences of shutting down the entire economy. I know we know how to solve more than 90% of the problems some countries are facing with child mortality because other countries have already solved them. The mortality rate for under 5-year-olds in low-income countries is 14 times the rate of those same aged kids in high-income countries. Why is the world not focused on closing that gap? High-income countries clearly know how to effectively limit the number of under-5-year-old lives lost in a way that low-income countries must either not have the knowledge, money, or desire to do themselves. I doubt it is due to a lack of desire. Why do we as humanity let this persist, but when it comes to COVID-19, there is no price too great to save a single human life? If we lessened the death rate of children under 5 by just 10% this year, we would have saved as many lives as have been lost to COVID-19, and at least 4-5x as many life years, if not many more.\n\nThere are too many terrible issues for us to continue to pretend there is no price not worth paying to eliminate one single issue that has not so far been as bad as many others that we ignore despite the fact that they are much more clearly preventable and less costly to do. Why don't we save the kids?"}]}

The Bengals are 0-11 and yet today they will beat the Jets who just last week inspired a brief, rare, and always appreciated glimpse of hope after dominating a good Raiders team by a score of 34-3. Today's loss shows the epitome of being a fan of the New York Jets, Mets, and Knicks. Their tragic losses and inevitable disappointments are somehow as unbelievable as they are utterly unsurprising. \"Classic Jets (or Mets or Knicks)\", they say.\n\nThere is, however, a silver lining. I believe rooting for these teams builds character. All my life they have lost, but they keep playing, and I keep rooting for them. They fail and they fail and they fail, but they stick with it, and I strive to emulate that, failures included. I don't waste my time watching them as much as I used to, and that's a good thing too. After all, I do not aspire to be remembered as the best Jets, Mets, Knicks fan there ever was. I just want to have a Jets team to be excited about some Sundays, a Mets team to root for in October every few years, and a magically hot Knicks team to go see in the Garden. For all that we do not know about winning and championships, we know about finding hope where most would not, about failing, persisting, and always believing. One day, we will win it all.\n\nLastly, if today's Jets game was not so unbearable to watch, I may have never taken the action to begin this blog which was no more than an idea prior to the opening kickoff. So many ideas come and go without becoming anything more than that, and that is part of the reason why I have started this blog. If you like it, you can thank the Jets."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Defining Altruism\n\nThere are a couple of different definitions of altruism. One is for humans and one is for animals.\n\nThe philosophical definition for humans characterizes an action as altruistic if it is done with the selfless and conscious intention of benefiting another human's well-being. The biological definition for animals is slightly but crucially less demanding. It does not involve moral highness nor is it concerned with the altruistic actor's intentions. Instead, it is the consequences of the action alone that determine whether that action is altruistic.\n\nSpecifically, altruistic acts in the animal kingdom must increase the reproductive fitness of the species. In other words, it is a means by which individual animals can increase the success of their own genes by furthering the prosperity of their own species. It may be selfless of the animal or it may not be. It does not matter what the animal's intention is. Other animals are not going to call them out on social media for having selfish intentions disguised as selfless acts. To act altruistically, an animal simply needs to do something that will increase the success of their genes and of their species. In biology, that is enough.\n\nI believe we should be less demanding when it comes to judging human actions of altruism as well. We are animals, after all. We should judge actions less on intentions and more on results. We should ask what the impact of people's actions are on other people, not what their intentions are in doing it. Setting a lower, more reasonable, and more objectively possible bar for altruistic action should theoretically increase the frequency of its occurrence. People would be less concerned with being judged negatively for trying to do something good. As a result, they would do good things more often.\n\nPeople are judged negatively for trying to do good all of the time. I worked at the local Boys & Girls Club during the second semester of my senior year as part of a capstone program from my major in human and organizational development. My boss at the time opened my eyes to an unfortunate phenomonen that existed in the non-profit world. There is a great [TED talk on the topic by Dan Pallotta](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong?language=en). The short version is that non-profit employees do not get paid enough. The longer version is that they do not get paid enough because their organizations are judged heavily (and counterproductively) by the percentage of total donated funds that go directly to the cause as opposed to administration and overhead. Paying people less draws lower quality talent. This is intuitive. Yet we expect non-profit employees not only to do good through their work but also to take a pay cut on what they could earn elsewhere in order to do it. That seems unreasonable to me. We should judge non-profits on their total impact, not on what percentage of the money they raise goes directly to the cause. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former CEO of Save the Children, [was paid $309,524.12 in 2018](https://www.savethechildren.net/about-us/accountability). People working in finance, tech, and many other industries can earn higher salaries than that before they turn 30. If anything, we should be paying non-profit employees more than they could earn in other industries. That way, we would incentivize the smartest people in the world to work on solving the biggest problems in the world and helping the people who need it most.\n\nYesterday, [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/business/shake-shack-returning-loan-ppp-coronavirus.html) reported on the story of Shake Shack returning a $10 million loan that it received from the recently enacted federal Paycheck Protection Program. In his public announcement regarding this return, Shake Shack's CEO [wrote about why they applied for the loan and how Shake Shack is burning $1.5 million per week](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shake-shack-returning-its-ppp-loan-heres-why-randy-garutti/?trackingId=95PlIjgRRoWmTNyoj0XR5A%3D%3D). After applying for the forgivable loan, they were able to [raise $150 million through a public stock offering](https://investor.shakeshack.com/investors-overview/news/press-release-details/2020/Shake-Shack-Announces-Aggregate-150-Million-Equity-Offering/default.aspx). As a result, they have decided they are now financially comfortable enough to return the loan so that it can go to businesses that need it more than they do. Now, instead of money, Shake Shack gets good press, or at least less bad press, and that translates to more customers buying more burgers, and in the end, it is all money. Because of this, few will look at their latest action as altruistic. Still, they were awarded the $10 million and chose to return it after their circumstances changed. That $10 million will go on to help another struggling business or more likely several of them. It was not perfect philosophical altruism, but the positive impact makes it a positive action from my perspective, and altruistic in terms of the animal standard.\n\nUnlike Shake Shack, many companies did not apply for the PPP loans. They may not have done so for a variety of reasons. They might have shared publicly why they did not apply for it or they might have kept it totally a secret. The ones who share publicly could be accused of not applying for the same reason that Shake Shack could be accused of returning the money, to gain good press, goodwill, and money in the end. It is harder to criticize the companies that did not apply and kept that fact a secret but they might have had their own reasons for their actions as well, and who is to say what their exact intentions were. At the very least, the leaders of those companies probably feel good about what they did. Is that alone too selfish to make it an act of altruism?\n\nAnalyses of intentions and accusations of self-benefits seem irrelevant and counterproductive. I do not care how some person or organization benefits from doing good. I am just glad they are doing it. In fact, I would argue that similarly to the low pay problem in non-profits, limiting the benefits that the people and organizations doing the good can experience limits the amount of good that they can do. In the above example for instance, the company that keeps their non-application a secret seems more altruistic than the one that shares why they did what they did, but the latter may encourage other businesses that are less in need to do the same, whereas the former could not multiply their impact by staying silent.\n\nOften times, we get out what we put in and we benefit from doing good. Forget about pure altruism. It can always be questioned and critiqued. Let us accept the biological definition of altruism instead. Let us focus more on results than intentions. Let us applaud those who do things that benefit the human race and let us encourage others to do the same. Let us do those things ourselves without worrying what others will think. If we all do good for each other, does it really matter why?"}]}

I have been and remain bullish on the company’s future success since 2014. It was the first stock I ever bought. Last year I once held more than half my net worth in Tesla at $212. But I strongly believe it will come down before it goes up.\n\nForget comparing it to other car companies (of which it is now the most valuable). With a market cap of $257B, Tesla is currently trading as one of the top 25 most valuable companies in the world. I believe it can and will deserve that valuation in time. I believe it can grow to be in the top 10 and even the top 5 eventually, but I do not see how anyone can argue that it is there yet.\n\nTesla today is worth more than either Amazon or Facebook was 5 years ago. One can argue about inflation or how those companies are nothing alike and it is a useless comparison if they like but I think it is helpful to context. Blind bulls may get angry and say whatever will make them feel better but they would fail to realize that I am actually on their side. I love Tesla and I am still rooting for the company and its ambitious leader as I have been all along. That does not stop me from being able to believe that it is heavily overvalued right now.\n\nFor what it is worth, I do not think Elon Musk was joking when he tweeted \"[Tesla stock price is too high imo](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184)\" just a couple of months ago. As of today, the price has nearly doubled since then.\n\nThe reason I think it is important for bulls to stop overinflating the price is that for any amount it rises over its fair value, it will likely have to fall at some point, and there are hundreds of billions of dollars on the line for industries, companies, and wealthy individuals that want to see that happen.\n\nIn the beginning, Tesla threatened big oil, car makers, and car dealers. If and when they roll out full autonomous driving and trucking, Tesla will be threatening insurance (because autonomous cars are much safer), truckers, unions, Uber, Lyft, and other autonomous competitors like Google. I believe it is conservative to say that hundreds of billions of dollars are praying for Tesla to fail. This massive opposition will not \"go softly into that goodnight\", as they say.\n\nTo be clear, I am rooting for Tesla all the way. Anyone who knows me knows that. Tesla is an awesome company. But today it is overvalued."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# The Weekend Miscellaneous #13\n\nI started writing in my typical Monday format this morning. I ended up writing a lot about the stock market and the Bitcoin halving. As a result, this post focuses mostly on those topics after a quick blurb about Paris. I also include a few recommendations from my weekend at the end. If you are not interested in the stock market or Bitcoin, even though I tried to write about them in a way that is accessible to everyone, you may like to skip those parts after Paris.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call  _The Weekend Miscellaneous_.\n\nParis - Lauren and I were supposed to be in Paris this weekend. We booked round-trip flights for $316 in mid-January and were going to see for ourselves whether a Thursday to Sunday long weekend trip to Europe was a reasonable thing to treat ourselves to. It seems that our experiment will have to wait. If and when international travel does return, I recommend [Scott's Cheap Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com/). The site offers a free email subscription which is constantly offering unreal deals on flights. I cancelled my subscription last month so as not to be consistently teased by temptations of international flights when I know I will not be booking them, but I set a reminder for myself to consider re-subscribing at the end of the year, or else delay the reminder to a later date.\n\nStock Market - Before writing this ahead of the stock market's open this morning, I looked at how the market compared to where it was on the first day of trading this year on January 2nd. Since January 2nd, as of last Friday's close on May 8th, the DOW is down 16%, the S&P is down 10%, and the NASDAQ is actually up but only by less than 1%. This all seems absurd to me. Curious, I looked at the chart for the most recent market-wide fall before this year to help put the current one into context. I focused in on a 3-month period from September 21st, 2018 to December 21st, 2018. In that time, the DOW went down 16%, the S&P went down 18%, and the NASDAQ went down 21%. In other words, the NASDAQ had an incomparably worse time, the S&P was almost twice as bad, and the DOW dropped by the same percentage that is has this year. Do you remember what happened between late September and Christmas 2018 to drive that more significant fall in the market than we have seen thus far this year? Neither do I. I did a brief search to see if I could find anything of note and the biggest factors I could find were \"tariffs driving uncertainty\", \"Fed hikes interest rates\", and \"big tech under scrutiny\". These seem extremely less consequential than the terms that I would attach to the times we are in now which would include \"global economic shutdown\", \"Fed prints trillions\", and \"highest unemployment since The Great Depression\". So, what are the takeaways from this? First, it looks like tech broadly is doing better than the rest of the market this year versus the 3-month fall in 2018 when it was doing worse. This year, the NASDAQ (which is [approximately 50% tech](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaqcompositeindex.asp)) is flat while the S&P ([~20% tech](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-sector-weighting-of-the-s-and-p-500-4579847)) and the DOW ([~17% tech](https://money.cnn.com/data/dow30/)) are doing much worse. This is not a novel observation but one that I think is worth making. Second, and more importantly, it seems that one of two things must be true based on the current state of the market. The first thing that may be true is that the stock market is almost entirely detached from the actual economy in terms of the financial well-being of people all over the country, many of whom are unable to pay rent or buy enough food to feed their families after having lost their jobs. The idea that corporate profits (the market) may not be strongly correlated with people's pockets (the economy) seems reasonable to me, but right now the lack of correlation seems to be happening to a drastic degree. The second thing that may be true is that the market has not yet fully fallen from the severity of this global economic crisis which is hiding behind the headline of a global health crisis, not to take away from the tragic number of deaths that the virus has caused. As I wrote in _[The Virus Is Not Our Only Problem](https://blogofjake.com/2020/04/28/the-virus-is-not-our-only-problem/)_ , I fear that the consequences of our response may be worse than those of the virus itself. I believe it is only a matter of time before the stock market will reflect that with a fall more comparable to that of the recent recession rather than a relatively reason-less 3-month dip at the end 2018. I remain mostly on the sidelines holding my two shares of Amazon which I believe are virtually market-proof, a single \"[support share](https://blogofjake.com/2020/04/29/3-lessons-from-investing-in-tesla/)\" of both Tesla and Beyond Meat because I believe in them long-term but am not confident in their near-term, and a small number of shares of Twitter for those same reasons. All 3 I could see dragging down, potentially severely, with a broader fall of the market. Lastly, I made small winning bets on DraftKings and Peloton in the last month and am holding small numbers of each which have basically been paid for by my winnings. Some people call this \"playing with house money\" when you are only risking losing what you have already won. For some reason, I have always called it \"playing with monopoly money\".\n\nBitcoin Halving - I would be remiss if I did not comment on the fact that the Bitcoin halving is expected to occur just before 3pm ET this afternoon. It is a significant happening that has occurred only twice since Bitcoin's inception. It happens approximately every 4 years. After it happens, the amount of Bitcoin that is mined (added to the existing owned total of Bitcoins) per block (~10 minutes) will be half of what it was for the last 4 years, for the next 4 years. It will then halve again and the cycle will continue approximately every 4 years until around the year 2140 when it is expected that the last fraction of the 21 million Bitcoins that will ever be mined will be added to the existing owned total. That may be just about the only thing that I can predict with any degree of certainty about the year 2140. It is worth noting that more than 18 million of the ultimate 21 million Bitcoins have already been mined in the first decade or so since the Bitcoin network came into existence on January 3rd, 2009. The first block of bitcoin had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. As I am writing this, each block has a reward of 12.5 Bitcoins. By the time I sit for dinner this evening, each block will have a reward of 6.25 Bitcoins. The nature of the halving fundamentally builds scarcity into the asset. That is why many consider it to be like digital gold. The halving mechanism is a key part of what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. I expect to write more about Bitcoin this week, hopefully tomorrow. Make no mistake, I believe Bitcoin is an extraordinarily excellent investment. That does not mean it is without risk. Far from it. It just means that I believe the risk is very well worth the reward. The amount I have invested in Bitcoin is significantly more than the amount I have invested in all of the stocks that I listed above combined. I have invested more and more only as I have learned more and more about it. If I lost all of my money in Bitcoin, I would be very upset but eventually alright. It is a calculated risk while I am young and can afford to take it for the possibility of the reward, similar to the risk I took [quitting my job](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/13/why-i-quit-my-job-as-an-investment-banker/) several months ago. If I did not take these kinds of calculated risks while I was young, I would have a hard time believing that I ever would.\n\nLastly, I will share with you 4 things from my weekend which I highly recommend. These things include a book, a podcast, a song, and a product. I reserve the right to write more about any of them.\n\nBook - _[The Sovereign Individual; Mastering the Transition to the Information Age](https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720)_[ by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg](https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720)\n\nPodcast - _[Joe Rogan Experience #1470 - Elon Musk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8)_\n\nSong - _[Still Crazy After All These Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo1naJEacE8)_[by Paul Simon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo1naJEacE8)\n\nProduct - _[Tooletries Toothbrush& Razor Shower Holder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019H34XKI?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_asin_image)_"}]}

Before that, the longest I had ever meditated in one sitting was 20 minutes. The vast majority of the time, I do it for 10.\n\nThat always seemed to me to be the standard amount of time for a meditation, at least according to all of the major apps I have tried including [Waking Up](http://wakingup.com), [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), and [Calm](https://www.calm.com/).\n\nI have not experienced first-hand very many noticeable benefits from meditation, but I have heard enough about them from people I trust and admire to revisit the practice time and time again over the last few years. Still, it has yet to really stick.\n\nWhen I think of meditation, I don't think of the guiding voices in the apps. I think of sitting still with eyes closed, paying attention to the thoughts of my mind and the sensations of my senses. In other words, I try to become the \"witness\", as it is called in[ ](https://www.amazon.com/Untethered-Soul-Journey-Beyond-Yourself/dp/1572245379)_[The Untethered Soul](https://www.amazon.com/Untethered-Soul-Journey-Beyond-Yourself/dp/1572245379)_ , a book by Michael Singer which is the best and one of the only ones I have read as a recommendation from my mother (she reads a lot more than I do).\n\nToday, as I sat cross-legged with my eyes closed for an hour on the dock by the pond, I had a hard time with the practice. To be clear, for anyone who has not ever tried it, sitting still with your eyes closed for any period of time is hard. As usual, I noticed little benefit other than a quickly fleeting feeling of bliss in the brief moments after the harp of my timer sounded and I slowly opened my eyes. Admittedly, that part is nice, but again, it is quickly fleeting. My right foot went numb at a point that must have been less than halfway into the hour and so I was constantly tweaking my position to try to get the feeling back in the foot. That reminded me of a form of hazing which my fraternity brothers and I went through during pledging. So there I was trying to meditate, thinking about how I basically hazing myself. As far as my other thoughts were concerned, my mind wandered all over the place over the course of 60 minutes. While it did seem to slow down a bit, it continuously came back to wondering how much time was left on my phone timer sitting beside me on the dock.\n\nIf I had to judge this meditation, I might give it a five out of ten, but I suppose the point is not to judge it but to simply follow the advice of one of my favorite slogans of any company, \"just do it.\"\n\nAs with most things, I believe the practice must get better with practice. That is what I have heard at least. If there is any time to practice the practice, this seems as good a time as any to do so. I hope to write again one day soon with some newfound success in the ancient tradition of meditation. Until then, I figured it might be helpful to share something I have tried that has not necessarily worked, if for no other reason, to make it more believable when I write about the things that have."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Shabbat\n\nShabbat (Hebrew for “cessation [from work]” or “resting”) is Judaism’s first and most sacred institution. The concept is based on the biblical story of Genesis (creation of heaven and earth in six days) in which God rests on, blesses, and makes holy the seventh day.\n\nShabbat begins just before sundown on Friday and ends just after sundown on Saturday. It prohibits 39 categories of activities related to farming, hunting, building, creating, writing, and starting or ending fires. The most common restrictions today relate to electronics and transportation and both are prohibited not explicitly but rather due to the creation of small sparks involved in both activities.\n\nAs its name suggests, Shabbat is intended to be a day for people to spend time with family, friends, and others, and to eat, sleep, read, sing, and pray as they wish.\n\nAlmost none of this I knew before yesterday.\n\nIf it has not been evidently clear, I am not a very observant Jew. I appreciate my ethnicity, but fundamentally I do not believe anyone should be born into a set of beliefs, regardless of what they are. People should have the opportunity to develop their own beliefs, especially in the modern world with such easy accessibility to so many varying perspectives. I do however believe among other things in the power of faith, the practice of discipline, and the abidance by certain principles.\n\nAs such, I would over time like to develop a set of principles to follow that in many ways I believe will looks and feel somewhat like Shabbat. For starters, it will probably be based around Sunday instead of Saturday because that is more naturally aligned with the way weeks work in America and most of the world outside of Israel (where work weeks are typically Sunday through Thursday). Second, I would rethink the prohibitions to align less with the original categories and more with what I believe was their intent which was to prohibit the doing of things that we have to do during the rest of the week. For someone like me, these prohibited activities might include email, use of Microsoft Office or similar applications, and going into an office. Lastly, and importantly, I think the encouraged activities could remain very much the same. The contrast between the continued relevance of these activities as they were initially written versus those that were initially prohibited alone suffices to show the timeless importance of them. Think about how valuable and relevant it remains to spend time with family, friends, and others, and to eat, sleep, read, and practice spiritualism or mindfulness (more broadly than to necessarily sing or pray). Compare that to the modern relevance of one of the prohibited categories, “marking hide”.\n\nI am not quite there yet, but one day I hope to start regularly if not religiously observing a Sabbath of my own. It may look and feel a little or a lot different than Shabbat, but the intention will be similar.\n\nA Jewish friend once told me something that I interpreted as this, “part of Judaism is living by seemingly random rules you do not know the reason for, but you live by them because you have faith in the rule book”. This, I think, is what makes it very difficult for me to have faith in any one religion, though I appreciate various aspects and intents of many of them. \n\nI wrote earlier this week that I would post controversial opinions that I hold today but may change my mind about tomorrow. One of them is that I personally think the prevailing religions across the world are outdated. Many people agree with this but then in abandoning the concept of religion they also abandon all practices of faith. I believe a good future for all peoples of the world will require some sort of faith in humanity."}]}

I realized that last night when I was playing Backgammon with Lauren. I had a roll of the dice that gave me no choice but to leave one of my pieces exposed. The only choice I had was where to leave it. I could either leave it 8 spots away from the closest threatening piece of hers, or 4. That’s when I thought of the numbers on the Catan board.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F140215db-7c95-4722-8d5b-0bcd3128d1fb_1024x892.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F140215db-7c95-4722-8d5b-0bcd3128d1fb_1024x892.jpeg)_Catan board_\n\nThe numbers on the Catan board are presented as larger or smaller (font size) with a higher or lower number of dots underneath them (between 1 and 5) representing the frequency with which they are expected to be rolled (as the total of two dice). As you can see in the image above, the 6 and the 8 are presented as the largest numbers, each with 5 dots underneath them. That means they are the most common totals to be rolled. To highlight that fact, the 6 and the 8 are further distinguished from all of the other numbers from 2 to 12 in that they are presented in a red font instead of a black font (more on fonts later).\n\nThanks for reading BLOG OF JAKE! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nI remembered the red 8 when I had my choice to make in Backgammon, and I remembered the small 4. I didn’t remember how many dots the 4 had, but I knew it was not red, and I knew it was smaller than the 8. So I knew that the odds that Lauren would roll a 4 on her next turn were lower than the odds that she would roll an 8. I left the exposed piece 4 spots away. She rolled. I was safe. I went on to win the game.\n\nNow you might say that I could have made the same move even if I had no familiarity with Catan. You could argue that I should have thought of the probabilities anyway, and that I should have been able to figure out that an 8 is a more likely roll than a 4. You could rightly recite that there are 5 different combinations that can make an 8 (2+6 or 3+5 or 4+4 or 5+3 or 6+2) but only 3 that can make a 4 (1+3 or 2+2 or 3+1). But that takes some time to think about. Moreover, I might not have thought about it at all if my brain hadn’t suddenly gone to Catan.\n\nCatan didn’t just give me a shortcut to figure out which spot had a better probability of being safe. It prompted me to think about that probability in the first place. And yes, you could further argue that I should have been thinking about that regardless. But there is a huge difference between what we should do or could have done and what we actually do or would have done. And in a casual Sunday night game of Backgammon, when I’m just relaxing and not thinking too much about anything, frankly, I’m just not sure I would have thought of it.\n\nThanks to my limited experience playing Catan, I did think of it. And thanks to that, I thought to write this. It struck me as a simple example of how understanding different disciplines (in this case, different games) can be useful in unexpected ways. It never occurred to me that learning how to play Catan would make me a better Backgammon player, and yet it did. ~~You could even argue it made me a slightly better writer, because it led me to write this, and most people agree the more you write the better you get. My learning how to play Catan even changed your life a little bit because if you’re reading this then you’re reading this and you would have otherwise been doing something else. Nonetheless, I digress.~~\n\nThe takeaway is that understanding different disciplines can be useful in unexpected ways. More generally, exposing yourself to different experiences can be useful in unexpected ways.\n\nI’ll end with this Steve Jobs quote from his famous 2005 Stanford Commencement Address.\n\n> _“I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to [do calligraphy]. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful. Historical. Artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture. And I found it fascinating. None of this had any hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac._\n> \n> _It was the first computer with beautiful typography._\n> \n> _If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would never have multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them._\n> \n> _If I had never dropped out [of college], I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later._\n> \n> _Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.”_\n> \n>  _**Steve Jobs ([2005 Stanford Commencement Address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc&t=1s))**_\n\nOh, and as Steve liked to say, “one more thing” —\n\nThis winter, I’ll be coaching a high school basketball team (JV). I’ve never coached a sports team before, and I haven’t played organized ball since I was 17. It might seem random, off-track, and hard to justify. But I was interested. And my gut said go for it. Maybe that’s enough.\n\nSubscribe"}]}

You might quit your job, travel more, read more, or finally make time for the gym. But for most people, it is hard to say all of the ways in which they would spend their days differently if they won the lottery today. I think the honest answer for a lot of people is that, in addition to whatever else comes to mind, they would spend a lot more time figuring out how they want to spend their time. Figuring out is different than thinking about. It involves active experimentation — in other words, trying things. There are lots of things that can take weeks, months, or even years to effectively experiment with.\n\nI’m not a millionaire (yet), let alone a billionaire (yet), but already, in my 20s, I have been able to give myself 2-3 years of cumulative time and space to follow my interests, try things, and figure out how I’d want to spend my days, independent of financial considerations. I have learned that I like writing, podcasting, investing, coaching basketball, spending time with friends and family, traveling and seasonal living, doing life advice calls, reading, running and lifting, golfing, walking while talking, and a bunch of other things. All of these are elements of how I would spend my days if I won the lottery, and I’ve been fortunate to spend a lot of time doing all of these things in my times of free time so far.\n\nDuring these times, in which I have given myself tremendous freedom of time, it has been hard to completely ignore any considerations around money given that I do not have nearly enough to sustain myself and my eventual family for the rest of my life. That said, I worked hard over multiple multi-year periods and saved and invested well enough to feel good giving myself permission not to worry about money for months at a time. I still end up worrying about it from time to time during those times, and it may influence my decisions around how to spend my time to some degree, but I largely try not to let it do so.\n\nI want to know what I would do if I could do anything I wanted to, because I believe that, for the most part, I can. Perhaps ignorantly, I believe that if I keep doing whatever I want to do, if I keep trying things and seeing what I’m best at doing and what I like doing best, the money problem will eventually and sustainably solve itself. Until then, I’m happy to “sell my time” from time to time, whether that means working a job or running my own business or something else, so long as it seems like a worthwhile experience.\n\nIn the long run, I’d like to continue trying different things and figuring out more and more how I would like to spend my time if I won the lottery. I don’t think the difference between how I spend my time and how I would spend it if I won the lottery needs to be nearly as large as most people assume. I hope to continue experimenting for months or years at a time, and to spend my time more or less however I want during those times, increasingly figuring out how I would spend my time if I won the lottery. And then I want to spend most of my time that way anyway, without having to win the lottery first.\n\nSubscribe"}]}

If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day.\n\nWe are going the wrong way.\n\nBernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn't it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidates are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.\n\nIn terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a [study ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&journalCode=pssa)in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba95f7eb-96c4-4439-a065-f0178ad54a46_959x1023.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba95f7eb-96c4-4439-a065-f0178ad54a46_959x1023.jpeg)\n\nThere are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person's 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.\n\nPolitics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).\n\nIt is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.\n\nHere are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:\n\n  * Microsoft's Satya Nadella (52)\n\n  * Apple's Tim Cook (59)\n\n  * Amazon's Jeff Bezos (56)\n\n  * Alphabet's Sundar Pichai (47)\n\n  * Alibaba's Daniel Zhang (48)\n\n  * Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg (36)\n\n  * Tencent's Ma Huateng (48)\n\n\n\n\nThe median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading both of those efforts.\n\nThe point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team's quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn't mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40's to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Coronavirus\n\nI have hesitated to write about the coronavirus because I am so relatively ignorant on the subject in terms of all that there is to know. That said, compared to the average person, I believe my current perspective on the matter is relatively well developed. That is why I have decided to share it today.\n\nMy goal in this instance is not to make specific predictions, but rather, to share my best guess expectations based on the aggregate of the information I have read, and in the end, to suggest simple actions we all can take to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.\n\nThe three variables that I believe are most important to forecast are the number of people who will be infected by the coronavirus and the percentages of those people who will (a.) develop severe cases of it, and (b.) die as a result of it.\n\nMy understanding is that the traditional flu typically infects about 10% of the population with a death rate of 0.1% among those infected. Therefore, 0.01% of the total population are expected to die from the flu each year. This is still a lot but we usually take basic precautions to prevent ourselves from spreading it if we have it (not going to work, taking tamiflu, washing hands) or from getting it if we don’t (getting flu shots, washing hands). Healthcare systems do their best to treat those with more severe cases who need to be treated, and generally they have the resources to do so, here in America at least.\n\nCompared with the traditional flu, many of the people who seem to me to be well informed on the novel and still very difficult to predict coronavirus believe that it will infect between 25-75% of the population, with a death rate between 1-2%. The size of these ranges as much as anything else should serve to show how unpredictable this whole situation remains at this stage. The third number is not as important with the traditional flu but matters in this instance because of the potentially 7x greater number of people who could be infected with the coronavirus versus the flu (up to 75% vs. ~10%). That number is the percentage of people who will develop severe cases. This number I have seen projected at around 10x the death rate, so between 10-20%. It matters because if this number holds at a scale that ends up being on the higher end of the projected infected rate then the death rate could theoretically increase as a percentage of the severe case rate due to healthcare systems not having the resources (human and otherwise) to even attempt to treat, let alone effectively treat, all of the severe case patients in need. Ignoring this issue and taking only into consideration the currently projected infection and death rates that I mentioned earlier in this paragraph, the overall death rate in the population would project to be in a range that is between 25-150x that of the traditional flu at between 0.25% and 1.5% of the population (versus 0.01%). In the worst case based on these assumptions, up to 15% of the population would have severe cases in need of treatment (20% severe of 75% infected). It bears repeating that this is the absolute worst case based on the current wide-range projections that I have seen. Still, by those best guess projections it is a feasible case nonetheless and so without being too much of an alarmist I do believe it is useful to consider for the purpose that I previously stated of preparing for the worst while hoping for the best.\n\nThe measures that I have taken thus far have been easy and low effort. Beyond trying to spend a few minutes per day getting informed, I have made an effort to wash my hands more, trade hand shakes and daps for fist pounds (I do this a lot anyway), and from a less important than physical health, financial health perspective, I sold all of my stocks on the market’s open on Monday because I do unfortunately think that the panic if not the reality of the situation will get worse before it gets better. Hopefully I will be wrong, but I would rather be wrong and miss out on whatever market fluctuations may occur between now and when it all blows over than to keep my money in the market for the ride, especially when people have predicted a significant downturn that has yet to come every year for the last few years. This is a good time to mention that I am not a doctor nor a wealth manager, just a person sharing a few precautions that I have taken. As things progress and if cases start to percolate throughout New York City, I might become more inclined for however long the spread persists to spend less time with fewer people and possibly go home to New Jersey (by car, not by NJ Transit through Penn Station). I would also consider stocking up on 2-3 weeks worth of essentials (as I read recommended), being sure to buy things without near-term expiration dates which I would go through eventually anyway, again, just in case of a worst case scenario.\n\nI will close by saying that I do not believe in the utility of a state of panic at either the individual or collective level. I do not intend with my writing today to cause anyone to enter such a state. My only intention is to share what I have come to believe based on what I have read to date from sources most of which I had never heard of prior to this outbreak but which I have chosen to give varying amounts of trust based on their large followings, titles of authority, and as important as either of those things, the soundness of their logic and reasoning from my perspective. I of course hope that the coronavirus does not become the potential pandemic that a lot of people are predicting it will be. Best case scenario, a lot of people spend a lot of time and energy preparing for something that will not be nearly as bad as many expect it to be. Even then, our over-preparation might be useful in helping to make it an even smaller situation than it otherwise might have been. More than anything, I recommend spending a few minutes a day or even only every few days reading one or two updates on the coronavirus to gain a little bit better of an understanding of what is going on."}]}

You can know if you are doing what you are supposed to be doing much more easily than whether you are on track for your goal.\n\nAnother reason is that being process-driven has more upside than being goals-driven. When you are working towards a goal, you might well reach it, but you are unlikely to surpass it. However, when you use a goal to develop a process, that process may take you further than any goal you could have possibly imagined, simply by sticking with it past the point where your goal would have already been achieved. \n\nHere's one example I can share from personal experience. A few years ago, I got into long-distance running. I started with a simple process and no goal. The process was to run 5 days per week including 2 short runs, 2 medium runs, and 1 long run. Another part of the process was to add miles each week, especially to lengthen out the long run. I eventually got the long run up to 17 miles and with my 26th birthday coming up I set a goal of running a marathon that day. I accomplished the goal but stopped the process and haven't run more than 10 miles since. Achieving the goal marked the end of the process. If I never set that goal and simply continued with the process, I might have gone a lot further. 26.2 miles is extremely arbitrary.\n\nMost goals are arbitrary. You can go way beyond them. You just have to focus on processes."}]}

Even if my perspective on how to have great ones was good, I would contend that I am still too young to know. All I know is that I still have a lot to learn.\n\nThat said, I am a man of principles and so this Valentine’s Day I figured I would share a “principle for lifelong meaningful relationships” from [this post](https://twitter.com/RayDalio/status/1228393273426939904?s=20) that I read after seeing [this tweet](https://twitter.com/RayDalio/status/1228393273426939904?s=20), both from Ray Dalio, a man who seems to know a thing or two about relationships. Ray is the founder of Bridgewater Associates (one of the largest hedge funds in the world) and the author of [Principles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/principles-lifelong-meaningful-relationships-ray-dalio/), a book which has been sitting on my bookshelf unread for too long. I have copied the excerpt of the first principle below for ease of reference. Happy Valentine’s Day.\n\n_“**What creates and sustains truly great relationships (like great marriages and great partnerships) is the unwavering belief that nothing is more important than the relationship.**_\n\n_That’s because in all relationships there will be bad times and disagreements including very big and important ones, and what is required to sustain relationships through those bad times and large and small disagreements is the belief that no issue is more important than the relationship. It is that belief and the mutual demonstrated commitment to it that creates the willingness to work things out so that the bad times and the disagreements are gotten through together. Each needs to give that type of commitment and to see the other give it in order to have the great relationship. If you both believe hard enough that that’s true and operate as though it is true, it will probably become true, and if you don’t believe it’s true or you don’t act as though it’s true it doesn’t have a chance of becoming true. It is that demonstrated that is true love._\n\n_Of course, in the early stage of a relationship there is no reason to believe that nothing is more important than the relationship and that the mutual commitments are there because that hasn’t been well tested. Because of that, you just have to have faith that it’s true and act as if it’s true and then see if the other person does the same. And of course, just the belief that the relationship is more important than the issues will not matter if the issues are really more important than the relationship. So, when facing those challenging bad times and disagreements in a relationship, and when making those important calls of what’s most important, you need to think hard about how important the relationship you have really is relative to how important getting your way is because the decisions you will make at those times either strengthen your relationship or weaken it.”_"}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# 3 Lessons from investing in Tesla\n\nOne of my best investments was also one of my worst.\n\nOn August 23rd, 2019, I invested more than one-third of my liquid net worth in Tesla, buying at a price of $212.88. This was more than doubling down on the number of Tesla shares that I already owned at that point. In total, more than half of my liquid net worth was now in Tesla. Any traditional investor will tell you that it is never smart to have such a high percentage of your money invested in a single asset, let alone a stock like Tesla which is one of the most volatile stocks in the market.\n\nIn this case, it worked for me. Perhaps it was smart. Perhaps it was lucky. Most likely, as with all investing, the success came from some combination of both. If I simply held onto all of my Tesla shares from then until now I would have more than doubled my liquid net worth in less than a year. The price today opened just under $800. My decision to buy a lot at $212.88 made it one of the best investments of my life. My decision to sell made it one of the worst. It could have been so much better.\n\nLet me explain how and why I sold before getting to the lessons that I took away from all of this. With such a large percentage of money on Tesla, my plan before I bought the latest lot was to sell a bunch of shares once I broke even on my overall investment in the company. I was down on the position that I held before my latest buy and buying more would allow me to breakeven overall at a lower price by lowering my average cost per share. I executed that plan just as I designed it and lightened the load significantly exactly one month after doubling down. This enabled me take a lot of risk off of the table and hold onto the rest of my shares which were now in the green. Additionally, the week that I sold was the same week that I quit my job, and without a steady flow of significant income in the foreseeable future, I knew that I needed to de-risk my portfolio. Lastly, I did not want to be following stocks closely on my phone while I was traveling the world and when I am invested in a number of things I naturally tend to check on them often. For a number of reasons, I knew taking most of my chips off of the table was the right thing to do. I sold the majority of my shares at $241.81. Just five months later, I watched those share pass a price of $900. Trust me, it was a tough pill to swallow.\n\nDuring my travels, I ended up selling the remainder of my shares in Tesla at a higher price but also much lower than where it is now. I sold at $335. In all, my Tesla profits were still significant. They paid for the entirety of my travels. I made good money and I cannot complain, but I could have made so much more. As with most learning experiences, it was a bit painful to go through, but I have taken away a few lessons in investing as a result. I choose to believe everything happens for a reason. If I had to guess, the lesson of selling too soon on Tesla will help me to make better investment decisions now and in the future which will have much greater positive impacts than this one did a negative.\n\nHere are a few of the specific lessons that I am taking away:\n\n  1. _**Know the why for what you do**_ \\-- Because I knew why I was selling the majority of my shares when I did, I cannot look back and fault the trade. Sure, it would have been great to have held, but it is simply not the move to take that kind of risk when one is out of a job. Looking at the stock's movement in retrospect, it becomes obvious that I should have held, but that future was far from guaranteed, and I can look back with the comfort of knowing why I did what I did, and still believing it was the right thing to do. If you have great confidence in your reasoning, its correctness will persist regardless of what happens later. That will make it easier to live with the consequences if you miss out on a big gain like I did, which is a much better way to fail by the way than getting caught with a big loss.\n\n  2. _**Always own a piece of what you believe in**_ \\-- When I sold the remainder of my shares at $335, I should have held on to some. Unlike selling the majority of my shares when I broke even and was about to quit, this is a trade I would do differently next time. I sold at $335 because the stock had popped to that level on a positive earnings report and the new price represented a 50% gain in a month. I still had a lot of money in at that point. I was excited to lock in my winnings and wait on the sidelines for a lower price at which I could buy back in. This showed an over-confidence in my ability to predict its short-term movements. That is not the game that I want to play anyway. The stock never fell. Instead, it turned out to be the beginning of a meteoric rise. From the experience of having to watch that over the next several months, I learned to hold onto small investments in the companies I believe in, even if I might think they are going to go down in the short-term. There may never be an opportunity to buy lower, and the potential small loss on a small investment is easier to swallow than having to sit and watch one of your favorite companies succeed while you are standing on the sidelines. Keep a small amount of money on the board and you can continue to root for the company with little at stake. If it goes up, your only regret will be that you did not buy more. If it goes down, buying more at a lower price will balance out your average cost per share, and so long as you still believe in the company, you should be comfortable holding for the long-term from there.\n\n  3. _**Do not let past mistakes cloud future decisions**_ \\--This last lesson took me a while to learn. In a way, it is about not falling prey to the sunk cost fallacy. About 5 weeks ago, Tesla fell to its lowest price since its massive rally. It dropped to around $360 which was just about 7% greater than the price at which I last sold shares at $335. I was excited to finally have the opportunity to get back into Tesla at the same price that I had previously gotten out. This was foolish. In waiting for the stock to fall below $335 only because I wanted to fully nullify my mistake from the past, I missed an obvious buying opportunity in its entirety. Before I could get my hands on some Tesla shares, they quickly flew back up to the 400s, and then the 500s, and then the 600s, and so on.

The purpose of this piece is to explain how that has happened.\n\nFirst, I want to be clear about a few ways in which I did not make money. I did not receive any government money through unemployment nor from the stimulus checks. Unemployment money is not for people who quit their jobs voluntarily and the stimulus checks were not for people who made more than $99,000 in 2019. I have not had any paid job at any point in the last 10 months. I did not start a profitable business at any point during that time. I have not made any money from this blog. My only material source of income has been through the appreciation of investments that I have made on my own, but that is not the part the matters most.\n\n**The Water Bucket Analogy**\n\nWhat matters most is how I have kept from losing money.\n\nTo explain, let me introduce a simple analogy. Think about a bucket of water with a hose that fills it and a hole near the bottom where the water leaks out. The water in the bucket represents your money and the speed at which it leaks out of the hole is the speed at which your money is spent. Most people have a paying job. That’s the hose.\n\nPeople want to increase their net worth over time and so naturally they think about how they can get more water faster from the hose. The better place to start, however, is to focus on limiting the leakage. People’s general focus on the hose rather than the hole is well demonstrated by the fact that anyone you ask will be able to tell you how much money they make by some unit of time but almost no one will be able to tell you the same in terms of their costs. They probably know the cost of their rent or mortgage payments and a number of other standalone expenses (by varying units of time) but very few will be able to tell you how much money they spend on an average day including their monthly, annual, and other periodic expenses spread out over the course of the respective period. I certainly could not have answered that question myself a year ago but doing so seemed like the sensible place to start.\n\n**Base Burn Rate**\n\nI knew when I quit my job in banking that in order to keep my cash burn in check I would need to get my expenses in order. I had turned the hose off so I needed to manage the hole. I started with my subscriptions (monthly and annual payments). I looked at the recurring expenses on my credit card and bank statements. I cancelled almost all of them. I had to add one significant one, health insurance, which my employer had been paying previously. I went with the second cheapest plan I could find from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield for $287/month. Next time I would instead go with the second cheapest plan from Oscar for $293/month because I like newer companies in broken industries and they tend to offer a better customer experience.\n\nMy next largest recurring payment was my phone bill. I went into the Verizon store and asked what the differences were between my current plan and the cheapest one I could possibly have. The only difference of any significance was the inability with the lower plan to use a hotspot. That infrequently used function was not nearly worth the ~$80/month difference in plans. I cut my phone bill in half to $78/month.\n\nBelow are the rest of my monthly and annual expenses as they stand today. As you will see, if I didn’t actively spend any money, these passive expenses alone would result in only a $15/day average burn. I call this my _**base burn rate**_. _Note: this figure was closer to $60 when I was living in New York pre-covid (+ rent, WiFi, utilities) and between $30-$60 when I was traveling in Europe and Asia (+ hostels/Airbnbs), but right now I am fortunate to be living with my family for free_.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7663a4d5-6319-4ce1-b659-3b2c34d1933c_515x213.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7663a4d5-6319-4ce1-b659-3b2c34d1933c_515x213.png)\n\nNot bad right? It gets better…\n\n**Passive Income**\n\nI think about my investments in terms of three categories – crypto, stocks, and real estate. Real estate is unique among the three in that it pretty predictably generates cash flows each month. This is because our monthly rents collected from tenants are more than enough to cover the monthly mortgage payments, the cost of our property manager (10% of rent), and any necessary maintenance and/or repairs that she facilitates on our behalf over the course of a given month. Subtracting those expenses from the total rent collected each month and splitting the balance with my good friend and co-owner Kyle leaves me to expect $319/month (assuming the average amount of monthly repairs) which comes out to about $10/day. This is a far cry from the passive income of a real estate magnate but it is solid for a first property and not insignificant for me when it is the only dependable income that I have. Most importantly, this passive income offsets two-thirds of my base burn rate at the moment.\n\nWith my base burn rate and passive income figured out, I can calculate what I call my _**net base burn rate**_ which in this case is equal to $5/day,\n\n**3 Basic Principles**\n\nAfter minimizing my base burn rate and estimating my passive income to calculate my net base burn rate, the next category I considered was comprised of the regularly re-occurring but variable expenses that cost me the most. This includes food, drinks, transportation, and entertainment. I came up with a few principles to help myself spend less in these areas. That said, I believe one of the best things money can buy is the ability not to have to worry about money so rather than force any hard rules upon myself I mostly just keep these principles in mind and try to be reasonable most of the time. _Note: these principles were most applicable when I was traveling and then living in New York pre-covid._\n\n  1. Food – don’t drink a lot at restaurants. You are there for the food and the company.\n\n  2. Drinks – drink less and mostly at yours or friends’ places. The lower your tolerance, the cheaper the fun.\n\n  3. Transportation – walk when you can. Subways are usually quicker and always cheaper than cars.\n\n\n\n\n**Exceeding Expectations**\n\nThe goal is not to be watching your wallet all the time. It is to figure it out, then forget about it. Knowing my net base burn rate of $5/day leads to an annual burn of less than $2,000 allows me to live and spend confidently because I know if I ever want to slow my burn I can basically do so simply by doing nothing (therefore slowing my active spending). I don’t _need_ to drink alcohol or go golfing and I could easily eat for a few dollars per day if I was willing to eat less healthfully and not go out for a while. Fortunately, I have not had to sacrifice any of these things. If I did have to, I know that I could, but I would probably just go and get a job at that point and realistically well before that point ever came.\n\nIn order to quit my job in the first place, I had to be willing to endure some level of burn in exchange for the freedom of time that I was buying for myself. I was confident that I could offset some of it with my investments in crypto and stocks, and the non- cash flow part of my real estate investment (the appreciation of the value of my equity in the property). Never would I have anticipated what has happened to date. I am pleased to say that between Bitcoin’s surge this week, Amazon’s last month, the appreciation of my Kentucky property’s value, and some other smaller stock and crypto investments along the way, my investments have now offset the entirety of my burn over the last 10 months. My net worth is slightly greater today than it was the day I quit my job, and it is not because I’ve been a hermit or lived a miserably frugal life. Quite the contrary. I traveled the world for a few months, had a four-month lease in New York City and stayed in a couple hotels before that, got a month-long Airbnb in Georgia with Lauren, have eaten well, been golfing a lot lately, and the list goes on. Not every day is roses. I would be skeptical of anyone who says that is the case. But I have not often if ever but rarely felt restrained moneywise. I have been enjoying my time quite a bit.\n\nWhen I quit my job, I figured I would burn a good chunk of my savings in a few months and expected I would feel the need to get a job after several if not before then. I thought it would be well worthwhile to burn that money in exchange for the time that I would buy for myself to do whatever I wanted. I was right in the sense that this time has proven valuable to me but wrong in another. It hasn’t cost me a dime."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# The Habit of Walking\n\n\"Somewhere at sometime he had discovered that a man needs a two-hour walk for his health\", said the son of the Russian composer, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, in talking about his father. I discovered this quote in a book called _Daily Rituals_ by Mason Currey. The book explores the daily routines of approximately 200 of the greatest creative minds of the last few centuries. Pyotr was just one of countless examples such as Darwin, Beethoven and Kierkegaard whose daily routine depended in some fashion on the habit of walking. In fact, besides my shock at how much smoking, coffee, alcohol, and to a lesser degree, amphetamines, were behind many of these creatives' brilliant work, I was most surprised to find that walking was the number one consistency I found amongst them. That is not to say that everyone included walking in the divulgence of their daily routines, but many and maybe even most of them did, and many of those who did walked significant distances indeed.\n\nThis is not the first time that it has dawned on me that walking may be a secret superpower of sorts to the well-lived life and more manageably the well-done day. I was first turned onto walking during my junior year of college while studying abroad in Florence and each morning walking out our apartment door, passing the Mercado Centrale, and then the Duomo, and finally taking a bridge parallel to the Ponte Vecchio to get to the main school building. I reckon it was about a 15 or 20 minute walk, and if there was any way to get introduced to walking, that would have been it, hungover as death, crossing maybe the most beautiful city in the world, with the Florentine smell of fresh pastries and espressos in the air.\n\nThe habit of walking each morning and throughout the day stuck with me when I returned stateside that summer and moved out to San Francisco for a 10-week internship in investment banking. I got a room in a three-bedroom apartment about a mile away from the office and on the same street called Sutter, just a block above Post and below that Geary where it really starts to feel like you are on set for an episode of _The Walking Dead_. Still, Sutter was pleasant enough and I enjoyed walking down it each morning, rain or shine, on my way to the office.\n\nThe habit stuck when I joined full-time the following summer and even after I moved to an apartment that was more like two and a half miles away. On Fridays, when I got out at a reasonable hour, I would enjoy the walk home as well, a rarer treat and welcomed way to start the weekend.\n\nI brought the habit back to New York too and the weather was worse but the vibe was better and there's no place on earth where the hard heel of a brown leather shoe clicks when it hits the ground like it does in New York, surrounded by suits and hunter boots on a rainy day.\n\nIn the last year, I started running more and walking less, but in the last couple of months, I have started walking more again. While running at a slow enough pace (which I prefer) may come to feel like a natural state of movement which one could continue for any distance and any time, walking naturally is that activity and it always feels that way. In my experience, it takes many more miles of walking than running to feel truly tired -- you can just go and go and go, so long as you don't get bored of it. For my commutes, I often listened to music or nothing at all. Now, I usually listen to podcasts, if anything. I find the podcast keeps me away from boredom but also away from my surroundings and my thoughts or undistracted being, all of which there is something to be said for. An hour-long walk without audio may sound intimidatingly boring and ancient but if we are to learn anything from some of the great creatives of the last few centuries, there is something to be said for the simple walk in and of itself.\n\nI believe walking is good for the mind, body, and what some people call soul. I've been thinking a lot this year about some of the best ways to spend my time for the purposes of health, wealth, and happiness. While I may not get wealthy directly by walking, I'll probably be healthier and happier, and any activity that covers two out of the three main things reliably is probably something worth doing for me. I appreciate that just because many of the greats walked a lot does not mean that it was causal to their success or that it is necessarily a great thing to do. I certainly would not suggest trying to keep up with many of them in the number of cigarettes smoked throughout a lifetime. Nonetheless, I think walking is a worthwhile habit to experiment with incorporating into one's daily routine, so long as one is able, and if it proves to be something that one enjoys and feels is good for them, well, it seems good to do the things we enjoy which feel good for us. Time for a walk for me."}]}

Harvard professor Clifford Woolf sat down with a16z for a podcast (linked below) to discuss the biology of pain. Naturally, the conversation covered opioids and what some are calling an epidemic of addiction and abuse. Woolf explains how some addicts describe never feeling a high as great as the first time and how the highs become less and less powerful over time. After frequent enough use over a long enough duration, these people continue to use not so much because they crave the highs, but rather, to be saved from the lows. Maybe that is why they call it a fix. The scientific term is called withdrawal reversal.\n\nI often point to this concept of withdrawal reversal when explaining to people why I do not drink coffee daily. I typically love both the feeling and the taste — even the temperature, the act of drinking it, and the ritual itself. Still, I do not drink coffee daily because I do not believe it is a good habit, and because I do not want to be dependent on anything to maintain my normal state. With regular consumption of coffee, as with many other things, comes a growing tolerance and a lowering of the peak high feeling, but the fall of post-peak withdrawal does not become any less severe. As I understand it, the same sized fall simply starts from a lower peak until at some point the bottom of the fall is as low below your original baseline (your normal state before your coffee habit) as your original and highest peak ever was above it. At that point, your new peak is the same as your old baseline and you are no longer drinking coffee to feel better than your natural normal but simply to not feel worse.\n\nI am not necessarily advising you to stop drinking coffee daily. I think different things impact different people in different ways, and like I said, I am not a doctor. More than anything, I think the concept of withdrawal reversal and its role in the phenomenon of addiction is important to understand as it relates to everything from opioids and coffee to juul and adderall and maybe even my addiction to my phone which I imagine pales in comparison to that of many. With coffee, I have on average a cup or two a week, and I try to have it on days when I can do things that I want to do more than on days when I have things that I have to do. It feels more like a want than a need that way. My father, a doctor, often advocates for the simple sounding but challenging to abide by principle of everything in moderation. In large part because of the concept of withdrawal reversal, I believe we would be wise to strive for moderation in many areas of consumption. Now, I think I will go treat myself to a coffee today.\n\nhttps://a16z.com/2019/09/17/biology-pain-clifford-woolf/"}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# The Lighthouse\n\nSo I was walking on the beach this morning. And I was like 2 miles down, about as far as I’ve ever gone. I walk a lot further around town, but I don’t usually go far on the beach. It’s harder to walk on sand. And I can’t do phone calls because it’s too windy. Most of my longest walks are phone calls. So I'm not one of those people who says they like long walks on the beach. I like short walks on the beach, and long walks around town. \n\nSo I was about 2 miles down, rounding the corner of the furthest part of the beach that you can see from where I started. I usually turn around when I get there, if I get there, which is rare. It feels natural to turn around once you get passed the furthest point you can see. But once you get passed that point, in this case, you can see a lighthouse.\n\nThe lighthouse is another half mile or so around the bend. That’s a bit of a ways when you’re walking on soft sand. It's even further when you know every step onward means another step back for your return. I’d considered it once or twice before -- going all the way to the lighthouse -- but I’d never done it. I’d only even gone as far as the bend a few times, maybe a handful. But today was the day. I decided I was going all the way.\n\nWhen I got to the lighthouse, or almost there I should say, I came upon an unforeseen obstacle. The lighthouse was protected by a big row of rocks on the water side, and then a fescued dune on my right. I could have climbed over the rocks or through the dunes in around 20 seconds without much trouble if I wanted to, and I would have gone over the rocks out of respect for the dunes, but those obstacles were not _the_ obstacles. _The_ obstacles were the signs on the ropes hanging across both the rocks and the dunes which said “Please do not walk on the rocks” and “Please do not walk on the dunes”. So I had a choice to make. I had 4 options. 1. Walk on the rocks. 2. Walk on the dunes. 3. Turn around and go home. or 4. Retrace my steps back about 100 yards to a path that goes off the beach and into a parking lot from which I knew I could walk to the lighthouse. The fourth option was the most complicated of the bunch, and made for the longest walk overall. But it was the only option that did not involve giving up or breaking the rules. And that was the spark for this story.\n\nWalking somewhere is like working toward something. Sometimes you work for a long time. Other times you give up fairly quickly. If you do go far, a common time to quit is when you get as far as you could have envisioned when you started. It’s rare to continue far beyond the furthest point you could see when you started your walk on the beach. But still, some do. Some pursue the lighthouse. But when you get there, or almost there, so close to \"there\" that most people would count it as there, there can often be obstacles. Very few people get to this point, and of those who do, some might try to take a shortcut. Many would just turn around. It is an easy negotiation to convince yourself that you've gone far enough, that it still counts. But you know what you meant when you went for the lighthouse. You meant all the way.\n\nSo here you are, with a dilemma most don’t go far enough to face. There are effectively 3 options if you combine the rocks and the dunes. 1. Take a shortcut by breaking the rules. 2. Turn around. or 3. Go the extra distance to get around the obstacle and reach the destination. So I stood there deliberating. And I really considered all three options. I justified the shortcut. _These rules seem kind of dumb. I'll be through the rocks in no time._ I justified just turning around. _How much do I really care about reaching this lighthouse anyway? It was more of a casual objective than something serious. This could count._\n\nBut I realized this wasn’t about the lighthouse. This was about what kind of person I wanted to be. “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” So is doing things the right way, and doing the right thing. I walked back 100 yards and took the path off the beach. I walked through the parking lot and to the lighthouse. The final stretch was as pictured below, a glorious approach to my final destination. I touched the black door, and then the white wall, and walked all the way around it, counterclockwise, dragging my hand over the bricks as I did. I touched the door again, and then the handle, and headed home.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27016dcd-fa03-4b52-ba04-627fbe9090e4_768x1024.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27016dcd-fa03-4b52-ba04-627fbe9090e4_768x1024.jpeg)"}]}

As usual, we got two pizzas. This time, it was one plain and one margherita, both with sausage and meatballs on half. It was like a pizza venn diagram, and it was delicious. It has been more than 3 months now since I started practicing my [gluten-free vegan diet with intermittent fasting](https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/21/the-gluten-free-vegan-diet-intermittent-fasting-and-green-smoothies/) during the week. The weekend freedom permitted by the program is as enjoyable as it is to feel good and clear-headed and healthy during the week. Since the beginning of our pizza night tradition, I am probably averaging four slices on Saturday nights with another one cold the next morning. This weekend, it was four at night and two in the morning.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call  _The Weekend Miscellaneous_.\n\nChanging it up a bit from my typical posts on _The Weekend Miscellaneous_ , today I will be proposing an answer to a specific question.\n\n_**Does cannabis consumption in moderation make people lazy?**_\n\nI believe the answer is no. You probably want to know why I believe that. Let me tell you.\n\nYesterday, I consumed 8 milligrams worth of THC and proceeded to run a half marathon (13.1 miles). That is the furthest I have run in my life. My pace was faster than when I ran a 19K (11.8 miles) two Sundays prior to raise awareness for our [COVID-19K Feeding America fundraiser](https://www.gofundme.com/manage/covid-19k) which has so far raised over $2,000 [equating to more than 20,000 meals according to Feeding America](https://www.feedingamerica.org/ways-to-give/faq/about-our-claims).\n\nMy experience yesterday leads me to believe with a high level of conviction that, specifically, cannabis consumption in moderation does not make me physically lazy or mentally weak, not within a few hours following consumption at least.\n\nI specify this more narrow conclusion in response to the broader question I am addressing so as not to over-generalize my personal and purely experiential findings. I am well aware that cannabis consumption may affect different people in different ways, that consuming a greater amount of it or the same amount with greater frequency may alter its effects, and that it may have less easily observable impacts on people in the long-term, among many other considerations.\n\nThat said, it bears repeating that I have observed for myself that the infrequent use of cannabis in moderation definitively does not make me lazy as a result, neither mentally nor physically. Instead, it seems reasonable to suggest that it may in fact make me more active in both regards.\n\nWhile some people use cannabis to help them sleep, I have found that it makes me mentally active, imaginative, open-minded and free-thinking. I had some of my best and clearest ideas in a while during my run yesterday and I can now both refine and build upon them with a sober mind. Basically, I have found that infrequent cannabis consumption in moderation makes me the opposite of lazy. It makes me active.\n\nThen again, just because something seems positive in the short-term does not mean it is a good idea. As a college kid curious about the long-term effects of cannabis consumption, I once did a literary review of the science on the subject as a part of my favorite class that I took in college. The class was called _Systematic Inquiry_ and it was all about how we know what we know. I would like to share that paper for those who are interested but it is on my old laptop which I did not bring home with me from my apartment in New York. I hope to share it another time. The biggest takeaway was that the scientific work that has been conducted on the subject to date leaves a lot to be desired, and although it did not convince me of any significantly adverse effects in the long-term, I err on the side of caution because so much remains unstudied and unknown.\n\nI realize that this post is timely as I was reminded that today is 4/20, cannabis culture's biggest holiday. I myself will not be celebrating. I had a little bit yesterday and I have come to believe in the benefits of being totally sober almost all of the time, having drugs even as widely accepted as caffeine, alcohol, and to a lesser extent, cannabis, only infrequently and mostly in moderation.\n\nMany things in life are bad to have in excess but totally fine and enjoyable to enjoy responsibly. I enjoy enjoying those things that way."}]}

You can learn more at Outlier.org\n\nOutlier is essentially MasterClass for credit transferable college courses. In fact, the company's Founder & CEO, Aaron Rasmussen, was one of the co-founders of MasterClass (I have some thoughts on MasterClass that I will share in a future post). The content and production quality unsurprisingly appears the same and that alone bodes well for the company.\n\nI discovered Outlier by the news that it just raised $11.7 million in Series A funding. For the time being, it offers only two courses - Intro to Psychology and Calculus 1. Unless colleges have changed a lot in the last few years, I imagine a lot of students would consider any alternative to the Calculus 1 class that is offered by their school.\n\nIt looks like the courses have multiple teachers for each subject with different approaches to match different learning styles. I would be curious to hear from students who took these classes in the Fall 2019 semester. My guess is that these classes are relatively well liked and that most students found them effective to at least a satisfactory degree.\n\nAs important as the fact that these classes earn students real transferable credits is the fact that they are only $400 per class, including textbooks. If you do the math assuming 5 courses per semester for 8 semesters gets a student to graduation, then a student hypothetically could one day get a full college education from Outlier at its current price per course for a total cost of $16,000. Compare that with the chart below from US News and keep in mind that those averages in the chart need to be multiplied by 4 to make them apples to apples with the $16,000 figure quoted above, assuming a 4 year path to graduation.\n\n[![](https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/8942b81/2147483647/resize/640x/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F30%2F9a%2F93d022484c38893d0d3ba4ba0573%2F190903-bcinfographictuition-graphic.png)](https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/8942b81/2147483647/resize/640x/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F30%2F9a%2F93d022484c38893d0d3ba4ba0573%2F190903-bcinfographictuition-graphic.png)\n\nCollege education in the United States is obviously over-priced. Everybody knows this as a widely accepted fact but the chart below should make it evidently objective for anyone who still has any doubt.\n\n[![Image result for college tuition vs inflation\"](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dff9875-d916-4471-8c8d-94e475426e56_634x491.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dff9875-d916-4471-8c8d-94e475426e56_634x491.jpeg)\n\nMaybe Outlier will be the first online program to crack the code on providing a successful alternative of scale for college education. Maybe not. Either way, I am glad to see a well-funded venture with strong leadership and a seemingly sound business plan attacking this problem that is well overdue for a fix."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# NFTs explained (so anyone can understand)\n\nI recently launched a project called [Base Colors](http://basecolors.com) — “The NFT collection for every color on the internet.” I started writing this post to explain Base Colors in a way that anyone could understand but I realized that, in order to do that, I needed to first explain NFTs in a way that anyone could understand. So that’s the purpose of this post — to explain NFTs.\n\n## NFTs are collectibles.\n\nYou know what collectibles are. Here are 10 familiar examples:\n\n  * pokémon cards\n\n  * baseball cards\n\n  * beanie babies\n\n  * vinyl records\n\n  * comic books\n\n  * watches\n\n  * stamps\n\n  * coins\n\n  * cars\n\n  * art\n\n\n\n\nNFTs are a new kind of collectible. More specifically, they are digital collectibles. They may eventually be more than that, but they are at least that, so let’s start there.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ced13af-a1b0-434a-90c5-b154bc60144f_18616x5924.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ced13af-a1b0-434a-90c5-b154bc60144f_18616x5924.png)\n\n## Digital collectibles can be valuable.\n\n_(just like physical collectibles, even though you can’t touch them)_\n\nThe examples listed above are all physical collectibles. Digital collectibles are a bit different. Namely, you can touch physical collectibles, but you can’t touch digital collectibles. This confuses people, but it shouldn’t. Just because you can’t touch something doesn’t mean it can’t have value. \n\nConsider domain names (websites) for example. Domain names are sort of like digital collectibles. Google owns a highly valuable collection of domain names including google.com, gmail.com, youtube.com, and others alike. You can’t touch google.com, but it is obviously valuable. You could offer Google $1 million. Google would never sell it to you.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff36135a8-71cf-4d86-b459-7dcb5cf98c64_5280x2536.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff36135a8-71cf-4d86-b459-7dcb5cf98c64_5280x2536.png)\n\n## NFTs are digital collectibles.\n\nToday, the most popular term for describing digital collectibles is “NFTs”. One example of an NFT collection is ENS names. ENS names are like domain names, but instead of ending with “.com”, they end with “.eth”, and instead of representing a website, they represent a crypto address. That means you can send digital assets to them. So if Google owned google.eth, you could send cryptocurrency to Google by sending it to google.eth. \n\nENS names can be valuable, just like domain names. Vitalik Buterin is the creator of Ethereum and one of the most well-known individuals in crypto. Vitalik owns vitalik.eth. You could offer him $1 million for vitalik.eth, and it’s probably not as valuable to him as google.com is to Google, but I don’t think he would sell it to you for $1 million.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ac9f016-c55f-40f1-9042-c71133691c10_5616x2708.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ac9f016-c55f-40f1-9042-c71133691c10_5616x2708.png)\n\nAnother example of an NFT collection is CryptoPunks. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 NFTs that look like these:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fe6f51a-b6ec-4769-8b2e-d4272e8b457e_1400x803.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fe6f51a-b6ec-4769-8b2e-d4272e8b457e_1400x803.png)\n\n## Some collectibles can be really valuable.\n\nIndividual NFTs from the CryptoPunks collection have sold for millions of dollars. That might seem silly, but some people really value certain collectibles. This has been true for centuries in the world of physical collectibles, and so far it has held true in the world of digital collectibles as well. \n\nHere are a few examples of physical collectibles that have sold for a lot of money:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f41c7ef-7393-49ce-a318-a4fb1f5f3666_14232x6320.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f41c7ef-7393-49ce-a318-a4fb1f5f3666_14232x6320.png)\n\nAnd here are a few examples of NFTs that have sold for a lot of money as well:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1942288-9ecc-4d07-a8c8-eff79813a9b9_14993x6140.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1942288-9ecc-4d07-a8c8-eff79813a9b9_14993x6140.png)\n\nI could show you countless other examples of each, but you get the point. It is fair to wonder why these collectibles are so valuable. I don’t really understand multi-million dollar stamps myself. But the thing is, it doesn’t matter if I understand it. It is what it is. People have valued baseball cards and stamps for decades and it seems likely that they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Collectibles are status symbols.\n\nWe don’t need to understand _why_ all of these different kinds of collectibles are considered valuable in order to understand _that_ they are considered valuable, but we can try. One simple way to think about collectibles is as status symbols. After all, you can’t really do anything with baseball cards or beanie babies besides buy them, hold them, enjoy them, show them off, and sell them. But watches are a bit different. You can do something with a watch. You can wear it and you can tell the time. Watches serve a function, and a useful one at that, but that is not why they are valuable. Rolex watches routinely sell for tens of thousands of dollars, but they don’t tell the time any better than a $50 Timex. They are status symbols. You don’t buy a Rolex to tell the time. You buy a Rolex to show your status.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c388b5d-78c4-47a5-bd20-bc104c8e68b4_11680x3780.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c388b5d-78c4-47a5-bd20-bc104c8e68b4_11680x3780.png)\n\n## Digital collectibles are no different.\n\nCryptoPunks are status symbols, just like Rolex watches. If you wear a Rolex watch, people will assume you are wealthy and successful. Similarly, if you have a CryptoPunk as your profile picture on Twitter, people will assume you are wealthy and that you were early to appreciate digital art, which might even mean you are smart. CryptoPunks are cool, just like Rolex watches, so some people value them both very highly. It might not make sense to you, just like paying millions of dollars for stamps doesn’t make sense to me, but it makes sense to some people. And you don’t need everyone to value CryptoPunks for CryptoPunks to be extremely valuable. You really only need a few people. The internet connects everyone in the world. If you can find one person who is willing to pay $1 million for your CryptoPunk, then that’s how much you can sell it for. And if you sell it for $1 million, then that’s what it’s worth. It doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc71cb39e-8a69-4e27-ae2e-09b15436bcd3_4872x2328.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc71cb39e-8a69-4e27-ae2e-09b15436bcd3_4872x2328.png)\n\n## The collectibles market is big.\n\nNow, it is worth considering the value of NFTs (digital collectibles) relative to the value of all collectibles (the vast majority of which are physical collectibles) because it makes it seem obvious that the digital collectibles market is going to grow, potentially a lot. Currently, the global collectibles market is estimated to be worth around half a trillion dollars, or [$473.81 billion](https://www.kdmarketinsights.com/reports/collectibles-market/7607) to be precise. The NFT market, on the other hand, is currently estimated to be worth [$4.7 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/nft/). That means digital collectibles currently represent just 1% of the total collectibles market.\n\n## Digital collectibles are still small.\n\nNFTs are still just a few years old, so while they’re relatively small today, it’s reasonable to say it’s still early. A good analogy could be to compare NFTs today to e-commerce in 2000. Just as NFTs represent 1% of the total collectibles market today, e-commerce represented 1% of the US retail market in 2000. Look at how it has grown since:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda8e4b63-1640-4288-bab0-515e2e43e09b_1318x450.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda8e4b63-1640-4288-bab0-515e2e43e09b_1318x450.png)\n\nToday, e-commerce represents more than 15% of the US retail market. Could NFTs represent 15% of the total collectibles market in 25 years? Neither the US retail market nor the total collectibles market is staying stagnant either, so the digital piece is not just a growing slice of the pie, but a growing slice of a growing pie. In fact, while e-commerce has increased from 1% to 15% of the US retail market, the actual value of e-commerce sales has increased from $5.7 billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $289 billion in the first quarter of 2024. That’s a 50x increase in about 25 years.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F595315e3-7aff-4d55-bfd9-5a1896f62e50_1318x450.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F595315e3-7aff-4d55-bfd9-5a1896f62e50_1318x450.png)\n\n## Digital collectibles are coming.\n\nI don’t know if digital collectibles are going to represent 15% of the total collectibles market in 25 years, or if the total value of all digital collectibles is going to increase 50x in the next 25 years. I don’t even know if they’ll still be called “NFTs”. All I know is that I will be extremely surprised if the digital collectibles market does not increase significantly both as a percentage of the total collectibles market, and in terms of its total value in the years to come. If you have a good argument for why the digital collectibles market should not represent at least 5% of the total collectibles market or increase at least 10x in value, I would love to hear it. As with most things, I’m open to changing my mind.\n\n## Base Colors are next.\n\nI hope this was helpful, and that you now feel you have a decent understanding of NFTs. Now that I have written this, I plan to write about my project specifically in a follow-up post. I believe it is something fundamentally new and interesting, but it is easiest to describe it simply as an NFT project for now. If you are curious to check it out, go to [basecolors.com](http://basecolors.com), where you can buy and name colors as digital collectibles. There is only one NFT for every digital color in the world. So there are 16,777,216 colors, but no two people can own the same color, and no two colors can have the same name. We made it easy enough so that anyone should be able to get a color. And if you have any questions, you can email me at [jake@basecolors.com](mailto:jake@basecolors.com) and I’ll be more than happy to help. As always, thank you for reading. I appreciate your support.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f4493b1-02f4-420c-8543-c563e6d1159b_2400x1200.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f4493b1-02f4-420c-8543-c563e6d1159b_2400x1200.png)"}]}

We had a great adventure of a month down in Blue Ridge, a beautiful place to spend some Spring.\n\nThe day before we left for Georgia, I wrote that I would be [experimenting with Blog of Jake](https://blogofjake.com/2020/05/22/experimenting-with-blog-of-jake/). That experiment is now over but my days of experimenting have only just begun. For some context, below is a brief timeline of the blog’s history so far:\n\n  * 12/01/19 – I begin posting once per day every weekday\n\n  * 02/17/20 – I begin posting _The Weekend Miscellaneous_ every Monday, still posting every weekday\n\n  * 05/25/20 – I begin [something different](https://blogofjake.com/2020/05/22/experimenting-with-blog-of-jake/) for the month instead of the usual writing, still posting every weekday\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow marks a new milestone. It is the beginning of a new chapter for the blog. It might only last a few days. It might last a few decades.\n\n  * 6/23/2020 – no rules\n\n\n\n\nNo rules means that I will write and post what I want when I want.\n\nI have written often how I hope my writing is useful, enjoyable, or otherwise impactful for you and I am pleased every time I hear from someone that it has been. Still, I have always been transparent that I am writing first and foremost for myself. It makes me think. It helps me organize my thoughts. It leads me to learn. I enjoy both the process of writing and the satisfaction of having written.\n\nWriting every weekday helped me build the habit of writing. It made me comfortable sharing my personal perspective publicly. It forced me to write on days I did not feel like writing and on many of those days I ended up writing something I was glad I wrote that I never otherwise would have written. This is a benefit of self-imposed rules. They can make you do things you will be glad you did that you never otherwise would have chosen to do, like writing when you don’t feel like it or [running in the winter in the rain.](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/06/running-in-the-winter-in-the-rain/)\n\nAs much as I believe in making rules, I also believe in breaking them.\n\nTomorrow is my 26th birthday, a great day to make a change.\n\nI will still be writing. I will still be posting. One thing that was hard to do when I was writing every weekday was to go deeper into subjects and spend more time over a number of days writing and editing and working on the same piece. I am hoping to do some more of that.\n\nThrough great luck and a couple years of hard work, I was fortunate to be able to gift myself this time not to need to worry about making money or getting a job. That said, as the slow burn of money continues and the months since I was last employed add up, I am frequently reminded that all things are fleeting, including the nature of this particular period of my life. I am reminded of the value of the gift of freedom that I have given myself, and the fact that there are many amazing things that I can do with it.\n\nWhen all rules are removed and one no longer feels they _have_ to do anything, one can begin to see more clearly what one wants to do simply by observing what one does. I do not know exactly how much or how little I will be writing and posting in the immediate future, but I know that I will be doing both. I already have a couple of pieces in the works that I got started in Georgia and I am excited to eventually share them with you. I believe that this is still the very beginning for Blog of Jake. This might be a good time to subscribe (just below the end of this paragraph on the left). That way, when I do post, you will not miss it. Thank you as always for reading.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nJake"}]}

For those who are not, you can think of it as Chipotle for salads, though that comparison loses its validity as you come to understand the nuances of the brand. I had a salad from Sweetgreen yesterday and the place was absolutely packed, even at an off hour. That has prompted me to share a few short paragraphs that I have previously written on this company which I believe will continue to grow very successfully.\n\nI have enjoyed being a Sweetgreen customer for more than two years now. While the brand has already garnered a lot of attention and a $1.6B valuation, I believe it has a much larger and brighter future ahead if it continues to execute so well on its mission. When you compare Sweetgreen to Chipotle (~15x SG’s valuation) or McDonald’s (~100x SG’s valuation), it becomes clear that if Sweetgreen can truly become the direct-to-consumer food platform of the modern day generation, the upside is far greater than its current valuation. \n\nThe brand’s focus on sustainability, local sourcing, and animal welfare aligns squarely with the food-related issues that people today care about most and that they will continue to care about in years ahead. The direct-to-consumer approach initiated by the popular Sweetgreen app (which I understand processes about half of total orders) and expanded by the recent launch of Sweetgreen outpost is a strategy that has proven across various categories to resonate well with today’s consumers. \n\nSweetgreen is building that direct relationship with its customers based on trust (using blockchain, the latest innovation in the concept of trust itself, to facilitate the traceability of ingredients), meeting customers where they are, and personalizing their food experiences based on where they live, which season it is, and what they like to eat. Interestingly, I heard one of the founders make the analogy that as books are to Amazon, salads will be to Sweetgreen. He believes and I agree that it has the potential to provide people with several meals a week, and I have already seen this come to fruition. \n\nOne of my best friends from my old office in San Francisco once went an entire month eating only Sweetgreen for lunches and dinners. I myself frequently went and got both dinner and lunch for the next day, multiple times per week. In summary, I am excited by Sweetgreen because I believe it is poised to become an extremely successful food brand and potentially a ubiquitous food platform built upon the values of modern consumers. For a growing number of them, I believe Sweetgreen will become more than just an occasional choice among many options, but rather, the default choice with many of their personal favorite options."}]}

But I believe that when it comes to audio vs. video communication, more often than not, less is more.\n\nAudio-only is less distracting than video calls. You can focus on the speaker’s voice instead of their bad hair day or visual tic. You will not be distracted by the goings on of any of the other people on the call who aren’t speaking at all. If you are one of those non-speakers yourself, you can focus on actively listening instead of actively looking like you’re listening. Even if these things only occupy 10% of your conscious thought, that’s a lot of unnecessary distraction. Most people have a hard enough time focusing for long periods of time without this 10% handicap, and I think for many people it may be much greater than 10%. In summary, to use the somewhat over-used phrase, audio-only has less noise, more signal.\n\nIn my personal experience, for whatever combination of reasons, I find audio-only generally makes for realer conversations, which are better conversations. I find them more enjoyable. That’s why I prefer them.\n\nI am not just writing this. I live by it and encourage you to try it. I record all of my podcasts audio-only. I join Zooms audio-only and hide the window with everyone’s faces. I rarely FaceTime my family or friends — I just call them. Usually I’ll go for a walk while we talk, another thing you can’t so easily or acceptably do with video calls.\n\nMost people and businesses started using video calls in recent years due to the advent of apps like FaceTime and Zoom, respectively. Since COVID, video calls have become the default. I believe this is wrong. Try some more audio-only communications if you can. See if it feels more right."}]}

I think it is a great age. I myself have been 25 for several months now and I certainly dig it so far.\n\nNaturally, we were talking about birthdays yesterday and she made me aware of something somewhat odd about them that I had never considered before. When someone on your 25th birthday, for example, wishes you a happy birthday and says something like \"I hope your 25th year is the best one yet!\", this is not exactly an accurate thing to say. Just as you begin your 2nd year of life on the day you turn 1, you begin your 26th year on the day you turn 25.\n\nI got to wondering who decided that we would identify our age in years based on the latest whole number that we had completed as opposed to the current year that we are in. I figured it had something to do with the language used for the common phrase of saying one's age as it would not be right to say \"I am 26 years old\" when one is only a month or two into his or her 26th year. Something like \"I am in my 26th year\" or \"I am on 26\" would work better for that. Sure enough, I looked it up and in [South Korea you are 1 on the day you are born](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/health/south-korea-age-law-intl/index.html).\n\nI suppose it should not come as much of a surprise that most of the world counts age by the lesser year rather than the greater one. Everyone wants to seem younger than they are.\n\nAnyway, by the time Lauren sees this she will have landed in London with her friends for what I trust will be an amazing few days in one of her favorite cities in the world. I hope her 26th year is the best one yet!"}]}

I like running in the city sometimes as well, but for longer distances it is nice to run without having to weave through walkers, stop at red lights, or get lost following green ones. To get to the East River, there a number of highway overpasses that can be taken to cross over the FDR Drive. When crossing over from E Houston Street, however, the crossing is not an overpass but rather a crossable roundabout with a number of traffic lights and a down ramp on the far side that runs down to the East River parks and running path.\n\nThis morning, I crossed over from E Houston Street and as I got to the ramp and began running down, a dog was running my way with its owner running behind it. This was not a coordinated run between canine and master. This was the canine escaping the master, and running right towards one of the busiest roundabouts in Manhattan. Noise-cancelling airpods still in, I got into a defensive stance and blocked the dogs path, eventually grabbing it when it tried to make its move, and holding it where it was up until the owner caught up.\n\nNow, I do not want to sound too heroic. Whatever dog you may be picturing in your imagination, I am reluctant to admit that it was only one of those small chihuahua-looking things. Still, it might well have been a dead chihuahua-looking thing if I was not turning onto that ramp at the moment that I did, which would have been the case if the traffic lights led me to taking the 5th Street overpass instead of the E Houston St. crossing, or if I did not take the extra minute to take a big empty shipping box down from my 5th floor apartment to the 1st floor garbage area this morning. Today's catching of the dog came down to a lot of luck and a little bit of having some awareness in the moment, as well as a decently imposing defensive stance, mostly due to my size, which is also mostly due to luck. This is a great example by which one can appreciate the butterfly effects of seemingly small and insignificant happenings, which I wrote about previously in my post called [\"No such thing as good or bad\"](https://blogofjake.com/2019/12/18/no-such-thing-as-good-or-bad/).\n\nThis morning I woke up at 7:55, did my fourth day of an introductory meditation series on this new app called [Waking Up](https://wakingup.com/) by Sam Harris (which I learned about through Tim Ferriss), drank a 32 ounce cup of water, wrote a page in my journal, ran 7 miles, listened to [this podcast with Laura Deming about extending the human healthspan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtGlblrBMCU) while I ran, and might have even saved a dog's life. Now I have also written my blog for the day, and it is still just before noon as I finish writing.\n\nI will close with the words that I so often write in my journal to kick things off in a positive way.\n\nToday is a good day."}]}

Please format the output as Markdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Impressively You\n\nAmbitious people often get stuck on popular paths pursuing prestige. It is an unfortunate but understandable phenomenon. Unfortunate because it traps people with enormous potential in relatively inconsequential industries like investment banking, management consulting, and law. But understandable because these paths make people predictably rich and perceived as “successful”.\n\nIt usually starts in high school. The highest achieving students compete to get into the most prestigious colleges — Harvard, Stanford, etc.. Then they compete to get into the most prestigious companies in the most prestigious industries — Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company, etc.. Then they compete for the fastest promotions, for the most prestigious exits, for more money and “better” jobs.\n\nThe problem is that these people, despite their consensus brilliance, often fail to think honestly about _why_ they are doing what they are doing while they are doing it. They optimize their careers for what looks the best and what makes the most (money). Then they realize when they’re 40 or 50 that they succeeded by everyone else’s standards other than their own. Deep down, they know they could have done something more interesting, more fulfilling, more different, but they didn’t.\n\nI was one of these people, and I could easily have ended up that way. I graduated from a Top 20 university and dutifully began my career in investment banking. I don’t regret either, either. But I am sure glad that I thought independently enough to start doing things a bit differently before I got stuck. Even before I graduated or got into banking, I started straddling the line between the prestigious path and a less predictable one. I dropped out of college after my freshman year and tried to start a successful business. The company failed, so I went back to school and then on to investment banking, but I got a taste of what it was like to do things differently than the other ambitious people around me.\n\nSo, after a couple of years in investment banking, [I decided to quit](https://www.blogofjake.com/p/why-i-quit-my-job-as-an-investment-banker). I didn’t know what I was going to do next, but I knew that quitting without knowing what was next was to do something different in and of itself, and I knew I wanted to do something different again. I ended up starting a blog, then a podcast, and then working full-time with Balaji Srinivasan, an extraordinarily unique individual himself, who I am proud to have served as Chief of Staff. Now, I know this is starting to sound impressive again, perhaps even prestigious, but it’s starting to sound a bit different too, and that makes all the difference.\n\nI left my position with Balaji last year and took some time to think about things. I cleared my calendar, followed my interests, and trusted the process — I had done this before. That led me to working on a short-term project with Peter Diamandis after having him as a guest on my podcast, the same way I got started working with Balaji. Peter is another extraordinarily unique individual. Like Balaji, he believes in a future that is radically different from the present. I believe in that too. So maybe I’m a futurist, or a “tech guy”. From finance to tech — not so unusual. Even when I was in banking, I was in the Technology M&A group. That wasn’t just a coincidence — I sought it out. So this is starting to make more sense.\n\nBut just when you thought you had me pegged, I went and did something that had nothing to do with technology or the future. This winter, I was the head coach of a high school JV basketball team. I’ll also mention I made a rap album several years ago. I acted in a couple amateur short films. I wrote a book I haven’t published. I sometimes wonder whether I’ve done all these things for the same reasons those ambitious high school kids I mentioned earlier seek to stack as many extracurriculars as they can so they can look as impressive as possible on their college applications, but I am confident that is not the case. \n\nHere’s the difference: \n\nMany of those kids do those things primarily because they are impressive. I do these things primarily because I am interested, and if they happen to look impressive, that’s great. In fact, I believe many people would be likely to do things that look impressive if they stopped trying so hard to do things that look impressive. It’s the natural result of doing things that you’re truly interested in, of caring and trying to do your best at things you think you might be best at doing.\n\nYou see, the point is not to _not_ look impressive. That would just be being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. Rather, the point is to not follow the most popular and prestigious path just because it is popular and prestigious. The point is to think for yourself, to follow your interests, to do your best to find what you are best at doing and to do it to the best of your abilities. You want to be impressively different, impressively unique, impressively you.\n\nAll else equal, it is quite helpful to look impressive. It enables you to talk to people you otherwise might not be able to talk to. It opens up opportunities that otherwise might not be available to you. But it is NOT important enough that you should sacrifice following your interests for the sake of looking impressive. \n\nImpressiveness is incredibly useful as a secondary benefit, but utterly detrimental as a primary pursuit. The challenge is trusting that you will get where you want to go, or rather, that you will be grateful for the going when it is all said and done, even though you can’t know where you’ll go.\n\nThe popular paths pursuing prestige are predictable. There’s a comfort in that. You can be 22 with great confidence that when you’re 42 you will have plenty of money to support your family. You’ll be viewed as successful and no one will question anything you ever did. You’ll have done everything right. \n\nIt just might feel wrong."}]}

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life._ \"\n> \n> Steve Jobs\n\nThis is one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite speeches. Steve talks about the importance of trusting in something. The thing that I have come to trust over the years is that [everything happens for a reason](https://blogofjake.com/2020/10/16/the-benefits-of-believing-everything-happens-for-a-reason/). I don't know if it is true, but I have faith that some version of it is worth believing. Steve describes some of the other versions as gut, destiny, life, and karma. His last option, \"whatever\", implies that it doesn't actually matter very much what you trust in, so long as you \"trust in something\".\n\nFor much of human history, religion was that \"something\" for the vast majority of people on earth. One could argue that that is still the case today. Technically, [they would be right](https://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2012/dec/23/84-percent-world-population-has-faith-third-are-ch/), but I can feel the role of religion in many households shrinking from a true practice of faith to a calendar of holidays bringing days off work and perhaps a few nice family traditions. There may even be a real remembrance of faith on the holiday itself, but it tends to be fleeting, an exception rather than the norm, and that's alright. I don't believe everyone needs religion. I just believe everyone could use some faith.\n\nGrowing up, I was extremely skeptical of everything. I didn't have faith in anything in particular. I pushed back on anything anyone told me they believed, especially if they tried to convince me to do the same. I think you can get away with this perspective as a kid. Perhaps it takes some child-like courage to live without the comfort of faith to fall back on. I remember thinking when I was very young, if I ever ended up becoming religious, it would be because I was not strong enough to deal with real doubt. I told myself never to forget this, and obviously I didn't, but at some point I chose to ignore it, sort of. I still don't believe every word of any religion by any means, but I do think there are aspects from most all of them that could be worth believing. More importantly, I have come to believe it is worth believing in something.\n\nSome people think that faith and doubt are opposites. As my younger self often said, I disagree. In fact, I do not believe one can have faith without doubt, for it is the uncertainty of the doubt itself which requires the faith. I once wrote, \"A true man of faith does not avoid the creep of doubt. Rather, he lives with it long enough to choose to believe a few things.\"\n\nYou have to know that [you don't know much](https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/13/i-dont-know-much-but-at-least-i-know-that/), but choose to have faith in something, or to \"trust in something\", as Steve said. His famous example about not being able to connect the dots looking forward was the story of how sitting in on a calligraphy class in college led to the introduction of beautiful font options on the Mac.\n\nI recently recalled an example of my own. In high school, I used to freestyle and record rap songs with a few of my best friends. I would never have thought that would have been helpful towards anything except the music we were making at the time, but I realize now that had I never learned to record and edit audio or become comfortable hearing my own voice, I may never have started [my podcast](http://podofjake.com). In a way, anything that the podcast leads me to now will be thanks not only to the podcast, but also to my high school days of rapping. Back when we were recording, I had never even heard of a podcast, let alone imagined I would one day have one of my own.\n\nPerhaps there are some dots to be connected looking back on your life which you can appreciate could never have been connected looking forward. \"So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something.\""}]}

I tend to enjoy commencement speeches and have watched several on YouTube from the likes of Jobs and [Bezos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBmavNoChZc) to [David Foster Wallace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI) and [Will Ferrell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfjGmBVAL-o). I recommend all four of those but none moreso than Steve Jobs’ address at Stanford. Two of the three parts that I recall most often are about the dots and the mirror. The third is when he says, “remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.” I have also had the back cover of The Last Whole Earth Catalog as my iPhone’s lock screen background since college. You will know what that says if you listen to the speech.\n\nWhile Steve Jobs had his own set of flaws like anyone else, I have taken a lot of wisdom from the things that he had to say and the things that others had to say about him in books and otherwise. I hope you will take the 15 minutes or so to watch or listen to his speech [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA)."}]}
