My criteria for considering guests to invite on the show has remained relatively consistent since the beginning. The first and most important criteria is that I am genuinely interested in having a conversation with the person. If I am not genuinely interested, I do not believe it will make for a very interesting conversation. Moreover, it feels like a waste of both my time and theirs. \n\nI have not compromised on this “interestedness” criteria at all but naturally I am more interested in some guests than others and I have found that, the more interested I am, the more interesting the conversation tends to be. That has been enough to support my hypothesis without having to actually run the experiment of having someone on as a guest who I am not genuinely interested in. That’s not an experiment that I am interested in running. \n\nThis may sound like an obvious criteria. Why would I invite a guest to come on the podcast if I am not genuinely interested in having a conversation with them? Well, there is at least one obvious reason which is that, even if I am not all that interested in them, other people are, and so it could be a conversation which many people might listen to. I imagine there are a ton of podcasters who don’t really consider their interest in a person as a criteria at all. They might start with a completely different question such as “Does this guest fit the niche that my podcast is about.” For me, if I am not interested, I am not interested. It’s a non-negotiable criteria, and it’s as simple as that.\n\nFor these first few years of podcasting, I have also had a second criteria on which I have seldom compromised. That is a prominence criteria. Once I’ve identified a guest I’m genuinely interested in, I secondarily consider whether they are above some subjective prominence threshold where a lot of people like me would be familiar with them. It is important to emphasize that this prominence threshold is subjective and specific to me and people interested in the kinds of things that I am interested in. If I show my podcast guest list to a stranger, they are likely to only recognize about one name — Mark Cuban, or maybe a handful. If I show it to someone who is into crypto, they might recognize several or even a few dozen. But if I show it to someone who really has a lot of overlapping interests with me, they may recognize more than half of the people I’ve had on my podcast to date. It is from their perspective that I think about this prominence threshold.\n\nMy logic was always that, in order to build a large audience over time, I needed to maintain a certain prominence threshold among my guests so that when the right types of people come across my podcast they will be inclined to listen and subscribe because they recognize a lot of people who they like, respect, and/or admire on my guest list. Additionally, if I did a good job I figured prominent guests would share our episode with their relatively large audiences and some percentage of that audience would listen and some percentage of those who listen would continue to listen to more episodes of my podcast and become a part of my audience. \n\nI have always had a long-term goal to have less prominent people on the podcast so that I can do my small part to help them get discovered and become more prominent in their own right. I concluded that I could not effectively do that if I did not first build a sufficiently sized stage on which to spotlight them, metaphorically speaking. I figured I could start with a high prominence threshold and lower it gradually over time as the audience grew. Even from the beginning, I have had less prominent people on the podcast here and there because I feel like I have some amount of “budget” to spend (in a sense) on these lower prominence guests without materially compromising my ability to hold a high prominence average and continue to build the podcast audience as I’ve describe. But something somewhat expected has happened, or hasn’t happened I suppose is more accurate. \n\nMy podcast audience has not grown that much in its few years despite all of my above logic, as sound as it may seem. It’s not that no one is listening — I get between a few hundred and several thousand listeners on every episode, with the median listenership being closer to the bottom end of that range. But this size was achieved fairly early in my first year of podcasting and has not meaningfully grown much since then for whatever the reason may be. Fortunately, I have never sought to make my podcast a full-time thing nor felt the need to make it monetizable as quickly as possible or anything like that. I often tell people that if I was doing it for the audience size or the money I would have stopped a long time ago. But I haven’t. I’ve kept going, sometimes more consistently than others, but mostly releasing episodes every week or two for the better part of the last 3 years.\n\nI still believe in everything I have written above, but I am writing this to draw a sort of line in the sand beyond which I intend to deprioritize my prominence threshold a bit. More accurately, I have already started doing this. I have realized that I do not really care about building a huge audience. It would be certainly be nice and preferable, all else equal, but it is not in the top few reasons why I do what I do, and it never has been. What I really care about is having interesting conversations with interesting people and sharing those conversations freely with the world, so that anyone with an internet connection can listen. That has been my real purpose for the podcast all along. \n\nI will continue to have prominent guests because prominent people tend to be a bit more interesting. They are somewhat extraordinary by default, given their prominence, and I tend to be interested in extraordinary people. But I am going to continue leaning in on inviting more guests on the podcast who are not yet as prominent as perhaps my average guest has been to date, especially when I am most interested in having a conversation with that particular person. \n\nIn the long run, I would still love to be able to bring more attention to less prominent people whom I find interesting, and the bigger my audience is, the more effectively I will be able to do that. But I have realized that my audience is sufficiently large to bring some attention already. Moreover, the quality of my audience is extremely high, and many of my listeners are quite prominent in their own right. I am regularly shocked by the caliber of people who I learn are listening to my podcast. And I have come to believe that it might be just as (if not more) valuable for an under-discovered guest I have on the podcast to be discovered by one person, if that person is the right person, compared to one thousand people by whom the value of being discovered is not as great for one reason or another. \n\nIn lowering my prominence bar a bit, I expect to be able to raise my interestedness bar even further than it has already been, and I am excited to see what results from that change in my criterial philosophy. I am also aware that sometimes it is right around the point when you stop looking for something that you find it, so perhaps deprioritizing guest prominence as a means towards the end of attracting a large audience will be exactly the thing that ends up attracting a large audience. I’m not counting on it, but we’ll see.\n\nI’ve already made many trade-offs at the expense of building a large audience (remaining pseudonymous, refusing to constrain myself to a particular niche, etc.), so this is nothing new in that sense. And you might not even notice a difference. I still expect to have many prominent guests because my weighting of that criteria will not go from second priority to not caring about it at all, and because I am very interested in a lot of very prominent people. If you’ve enjoyed the podcast to date, I am confident you will continue to enjoy the podcast in the future. And if new people are less inclined to listen as a result of a lower average prominence as it pertains to all the awesome people on my guest list, that’s ok with me.\n\nSubscribe"}]}

Henry is one of the more captivating founders I have heard speak in the last year. I believe in his vision and would bet on his leadership. Henry is an out-of-the-box thinker and contrarian who questions the defaults of the status quo. I like a lot of his ideas.\n\nOne of Henry's ideas is related to severance. Most companies have severance packages for terminated employees, but as Henry points out, it does not make any sense that employees who decide to leave by their own choice receive no such compensation packages. Henry asks why someone who serves a company well for 5 years and decides it is time to move on should receive less when leaving than someone who did a bad job for that company for 2 years and had to be fired as a result of their poor performance. It does not make much of any sense. That is why Carta initiated a sensible practice called \"equal departure\" in which employees receives comparable departure packages regardless of whether they are being fired or leaving by their own accord. Maybe one day some company will try a system where good performers who decide to leave will actually receive proportionally more in departure compensation than poor performers who are fired. For now, Carta's \"equal departure\" practice seems like a step in the right direction.\n\nWhile on the subject of Carta, I figured I would share an argument for why I believe the company is undervalued. I wrote this essay months ago as part of an application to an awesome VC firm that decided not to hire me. If you are not interested in valuation, you can probably stop reading here and move on with your day.\n\nPresent an argument for why one of the following is either overvalued or undervalued - Facebook, Uber, Bitcoin, or Carta. [750 Words Max]\n\nI believe Carta is undervalued. If I could invest, I would. Thanks to Carta, I may soon be able to.\n\nCarta’s latest valuation of $1.7 billion is based on the $300 million it raised to fund the enablement of liquidity across its network of private companies and their shareholders. I believe that Carta’s network effects have positioned it to become the leading cloud-based marketplace for private assets, and that opportunity represents an enormous value.\n\nIn estimating Carta’s value, it would be impractical to use intrinsic valuation methods such as DCF or LBO analyses because the company is still very much in its infancy. Methods using public comparables and precedent transactions, however, can be useful for the purpose of estimating a range of multiples at which the market might value Carta in the near-term.\n\nStill, there exists only a limited universe of loosely relevant public comparables and precedent transactions because Carta’s “Act 3” is such a unique proposition and the company’s growth rate has been extraordinarily high over the last few years (>100%). For example, despite their similarities to Carta’s initial offerings, it would be inaccurate to use precedent transactions like the sales of Solium Capital to Morgan Stanley or Equatex to Computershare at 7.0x and 5.4x revenues, respectively. These companies were not growing at nearly the same rate as Carta nor would they properly capture the upside of Carta’s forward business model.\n\nA more useful set of comparables includes a selection of high growth SaaS businesses (>30%) for both precedent transactions and public comparables where the median revenue multiples are 20.0x and 14.1x, respectively (see “Appendix” for companies included). Still, the median growth rate for those “high growth” public comparables is only 42.8% which pales in comparison to Carta’s triple-digit rate.\n\nIn order to best account for Carta’s growth rate, I built a regression analysis using the revenue growth rates of the same set of public comparables. This analysis implied a 38.1x revenue multiple for Carta assuming an 80% growth rate which is conservative versus historicals. The implied multiple suggests that Carta is undervalued by nearly 25% based on its latest valuation (30.9x its revenue run rate of $55 million at the time of the raise).\n\nAdditionally, the 14.1x median multiple of the public comparables serves as a solid estimate for what Carta would trade at in a downside case if its growth were to slow in the near-term. For example, if Carta’s run rate only grew by 70% in the year following its latest valuation and 40% the year thereafter, a 14.1x multiple could be reasonable. Applied to what would then be a run rate of $131 million, that would imply a valuation of $1.85 billion which even in the downside case by this logic is still a bit greater than its current valuation.\n\nBeyond the multiples math, my belief that Carta is undervalued also relies on my conviction in the market opportunity that Carta is after, the advantage it has earned towards capitalizing on that opportunity, and the ability of its leadership team to drive execution.\n\nI believe the development of Carta’s market opportunity is likely inevitable due to the growing issue of extreme and accelerating wealth inequality which, by definition, the vast majority of people will want to reverse. Carta will help to accomplish this by encouraging employee ownership, empowering all shareholders with liquidity, and enabling more people to benefit from the significant value creation that occurs before companies go public. \n\nIn terms of Carta’s advantage, I am impressed by how rapidly its network effects have established critical mass. Carta already has over 13,000 companies and 800,000 shareholders using products related to equity management that are firmly and comfortably embedded into their systems. I believe Carta’s significant lead over any pending competition will only continue to grow in the near-term as a result.\n\nFinally, I like what I have heard and read from Founder & CEO Henry Ward. I admire his vision for Carta and believe he has done a tremendous job thus far in leading the execution of his vision. Recruitment guru Lou Adler famously said, “past behavior is the best indicator of future performance”. If what Henry and the team have done to date is any indication, Carta’s future looks extremely bright.\n\nAppendix:\n\nPublic Comparables include Shopify, Atlassian, 2U, Smartsheet, Dropbox, Ring Central, Proofpoint, Twilio, Zendesk, ServiceNow, Everbridge, Mimecast, and New Relic\n\nPrecedent Transactions include Qualtrics / SAP, Marketo / Adobe, Adaptive Insights / Workday, Github / Microsoft, and Mulesoft / Salesforce"}]}

As TV channels are to TV shows, this podcast channel is to podcast shows. We will curate the very best podcast episodes for techno-optimists and post them all on one podcast channel, so you can get them all in one feed.\n\nTECHNO-OPTIMISTS represents the crystallization of two ideas that I have had for a long time.\n\nThe first idea was to create a podcast of podcasts in general. Many good new things have come as a result of bundling and unbundling. For example, albums were unbundled into songs which were re-bundled into streaming subscriptions. A podcast of podcasts is simply the bundling of podcasts. Podcasts are still a relatively new and yet to be bundled form of media. I believe they should be. I believe they will be. As for how this attempt will do, we will see.\n\nThe second idea was to create a content hub for techno-optimists. A few years ago, I created what I called The Techno-Progressive Content Library. It was a simple Google Sheet with lists of pro-tech movies, shows, books, and other forms of media depicting a positive vision of the future. These types of titles are relatively few and far between in our world of mostly anti-tech, dystopian movies, shows, books, and other forms of media, so we thought it would be helpful to organize them all in one place for the kinds of people who believe we can build a better future with technology.\n\nI never knew exactly what to call these kinds of people -- people like my podcast guests, like my audience, like myself. I've tried several variations of overlapping terms like techno-progressive, technological progressive, and technoptimist. But a few weeks ago, Marc Andreessen did us all a favor with his post, The Techno-Optimist Manifesto. I predict his prominence and prose will retrospectively prove to have had the power to align us all on one term from here forward -- \"Techno-Optimist\" -- and maybe this will do a little bit to help.\n\nTechno-Optimist is probably the best one-word descriptor of the kinds of people I've had on my podcast since Day 1, and the kinds of people who listen. I now have 3 years of techno-optimist episodes under my belt. So I figured if there is anyone to create a podcast of podcasts for techno-optimists, why not me?\n\nI pulled it all together this weekend and we're live on Apple, Spotify, etc. with a few initial episodes -- a few of my favorite conversations with a few of the most inspiring techno-optimists I've been lucky to have on Pod of Jake. The plan is of course to post episodes from other people's podcasts as well, hence the whole \"podcast of podcasts\" thing, so please let me know if you have a podcast you'd like to be featured as I work to source some others myself.\n\nFor now, check out our website at techno-optimists.com and follow us on X/Twitter @TechnoOptimists. Subscribe to the channel and leave a review on Apple or Spotify.\n\nAs always, I appreciate your support."}]}

You might quit your job, travel more, read more, or finally make time for the gym. But for most people, it is hard to say all of the ways in which they would spend their days differently if they won the lottery today. I think the honest answer for a lot of people is that, in addition to whatever else comes to mind, they would spend a lot more time figuring out how they want to spend their time. Figuring out is different than thinking about. It involves active experimentation — in other words, trying things. There are lots of things that can take weeks, months, or even years to effectively experiment with.\n\nI’m not a millionaire (yet), let alone a billionaire (yet), but already, in my 20s, I have been able to give myself 2-3 years of cumulative time and space to follow my interests, try things, and figure out how I’d want to spend my days, independent of financial considerations. I have learned that I like writing, podcasting, investing, coaching basketball, spending time with friends and family, traveling and seasonal living, doing life advice calls, reading, running and lifting, golfing, walking while talking, and a bunch of other things. All of these are elements of how I would spend my days if I won the lottery, and I’ve been fortunate to spend a lot of time doing all of these things in my times of free time so far.\n\nDuring these times, in which I have given myself tremendous freedom of time, it has been hard to completely ignore any considerations around money given that I do not have nearly enough to sustain myself and my eventual family for the rest of my life. That said, I worked hard over multiple multi-year periods and saved and invested well enough to feel good giving myself permission not to worry about money for months at a time. I still end up worrying about it from time to time during those times, and it may influence my decisions around how to spend my time to some degree, but I largely try not to let it do so.\n\nI want to know what I would do if I could do anything I wanted to, because I believe that, for the most part, I can. Perhaps ignorantly, I believe that if I keep doing whatever I want to do, if I keep trying things and seeing what I’m best at doing and what I like doing best, the money problem will eventually and sustainably solve itself. Until then, I’m happy to “sell my time” from time to time, whether that means working a job or running my own business or something else, so long as it seems like a worthwhile experience.\n\nIn the long run, I’d like to continue trying different things and figuring out more and more how I would like to spend my time if I won the lottery. I don’t think the difference between how I spend my time and how I would spend it if I won the lottery needs to be nearly as large as most people assume. I hope to continue experimenting for months or years at a time, and to spend my time more or less however I want during those times, increasingly figuring out how I would spend my time if I won the lottery. And then I want to spend most of my time that way anyway, without having to win the lottery first.\n\nSubscribe"}]}

I have been and remain bullish on the company’s future success since 2014. It was the first stock I ever bought. Last year I once held more than half my net worth in Tesla at $212. But I strongly believe it will come down before it goes up.\n\nForget comparing it to other car companies (of which it is now the most valuable). With a market cap of $257B, Tesla is currently trading as one of the top 25 most valuable companies in the world. I believe it can and will deserve that valuation in time. I believe it can grow to be in the top 10 and even the top 5 eventually, but I do not see how anyone can argue that it is there yet.\n\nTesla today is worth more than either Amazon or Facebook was 5 years ago. One can argue about inflation or how those companies are nothing alike and it is a useless comparison if they like but I think it is helpful to context. Blind bulls may get angry and say whatever will make them feel better but they would fail to realize that I am actually on their side. I love Tesla and I am still rooting for the company and its ambitious leader as I have been all along. That does not stop me from being able to believe that it is heavily overvalued right now.\n\nFor what it is worth, I do not think Elon Musk was joking when he tweeted \"Tesla stock price is too high imo\" just a couple of months ago. As of today, the price has nearly doubled since then.\n\nThe reason I think it is important for bulls to stop overinflating the price is that for any amount it rises over its fair value, it will likely have to fall at some point, and there are hundreds of billions of dollars on the line for industries, companies, and wealthy individuals that want to see that happen.\n\nIn the beginning, Tesla threatened big oil, car makers, and car dealers. If and when they roll out full autonomous driving and trucking, Tesla will be threatening insurance (because autonomous cars are much safer), truckers, unions, Uber, Lyft, and other autonomous competitors like Google. I believe it is conservative to say that hundreds of billions of dollars are praying for Tesla to fail. This massive opposition will not \"go softly into that goodnight\", as they say.\n\nTo be clear, I am rooting for Tesla all the way. Anyone who knows me knows that. Tesla is an awesome company. But today it is overvalued."}]}

It was scary when it happened but seems to be fine now, and we are highly optimistic that there will be no significant lasting issues from the event. I will not say anything more specific on the matter except, again, it seems to be that he is and will continue to be just fine.\n\nI did not much feel like writing today, but I do have something to share. It was a really tough day because of the thing that happened. I have heavily involved myself in the process of figuring out how best for my buddy to proceed, so it is not over yet, but I felt better as I recalled a saying that, as far as I know, I made up.\n\n“The worst times get better and the best times get worse.”\n\nThe truth in this statement cannot be logically argued. If the worst times get worse, they will no longer have been the worst times. Otherwise they will get better, so the first part of the statement must be true. People may not like the second part but it works off of the same logic and so if the first part is true, then it must be too. It should also be noted that this second part, while seemingly negative, could drive you to take moments in the best times of your life to be present and appreciative, or to “soak it in”, as they say.\n\nThe thing about the worst times, so far in my life at least, is they tend to be pretty obvious when they happen. A set of moments contained within a few minutes today were some of the worst times in my life. No question. Things have gotten infinitely better since and I am very confident they will get fully back to steady state soon, which fortunately for me means relatively good times.\n\nI feel very fortunate today as things could have been a whole lot worse. I am glad also to now have the added conviction of another experience to support my belief that the worst times get better and the best times get worse. It just takes time."}]}

It has now been more than two weeks since I have left the house by any means other than on foot or with any ends other than right back where I started.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nSix Easy Pieces \\- I started this book by Richard Feynman and am only through one of the six eponymous pieces. I do not know if that is an appropriate use of the word \"eponymous\" which is defined by Merriam Webster as \" of, relating to, or being the person or thing for whom or which something is named\", but it seemed within the proximity of proper usage and it is a cool word that came to mind which I wanted to use. Anyway, my understanding is that this book which is based on a series of lectures by the 1960's professor is regarded as a somewhat legendary introduction to the science of physics, and one of the very best there is. I took AP Physics in high school and did well but no longer have an AP understanding, or much of any for that matter, and I figured it might be useful if not interesting to be re-introduced to the subject. In the first piece, I learned about water and how it is comprised of H2O molecules which are made of three atoms which are each about the same in size to an apple as an apple is to the earth. I also learned how water turns into steam and ice and how it evaporates and how salt dissolves in it. Lastly, I learned how fires start and violets smell. Feynman also says in the introduction that the principle of science is that \"the test of all knowledge is experiment\" and that if we had to pass one sentence onto a future generation of creatures in a world where all the scientific knowledge we had gained would be lost, he would choose to communicate the atomic hypothesis, \"that all things are made of atoms -- little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.\" That sentence made me think for a while, as did many others in the first part of the book, and I realized that reading slowly is okay. It takes discipline, I thought, to read in a way in which one does not move forward at any point without understanding. It is quicker and easier to read without understanding or cross-connecting but slower and more difficult to read and to understand and to apply and to contemplate and to extrapolate. Still trying to figure out what exactly to do about reading, I decided I will try to read less but understand more, and in doing so, I will take my time.\n\nBurn After Reading \\- I watched this 2008 movie by The Coen Brothers this past weekend and found it entertaining enough to watch but only barely better than decent in the end. My favorite movie of the brothers' is No Country for Old Men in which Anton Chigurh is one of the best bad guys I have seen in any movie. My least favorite is A Serious Man. I do not remember why I disliked it so much, only that I turned it off about halfway through, which I rarely do. It is funny that I can hardly remember anything about it but still say that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Memory, I believe, is built moreso upon one's repetitive remembrance of a thing than of the actual thing itself. As such, even though I do not really remember watching the movie, I remember I did not like it and that I turned it off early because of how many times since watching it that I have remembered that I did not like it, and that I turned it off early.\n\nBedminster Pizza \\- for the first time since my family started isolating at home, we had a meal that was not cooked at home on Saturday night. We ordered a couple of large pies from Bedminster Pizza. This is a phenomenal pizza joint that cranks out high seven and low eight slices like any of the better known hot spots in New York. They used to have a newspaper clipping on the wall in which Trump said that it was his favorite pizza in the world. That got taken down around the beginning of his presidency, probably because it became a bit too polarizing for a bipartisan pizzeria in a blue state. I put their margherita slice right up there with the best of them, and I may have a little home bias, but I have never eaten with anyone who disagreed with it being a fundamentally great slice. From the sound of it when I ordered they are doing a ton of delivery right now and I was really happy to hear it. Not too mention, I imagine many others like me tipped them pretty fatly with a premium given the circumstances. Unlike many restaurants, I am confident Bedminster Pizza will come out safe on the other side of all this, and we will continue to do our part to help make sure that they do.\n\nTTYL \\- I discovered this app over the weekend which seems well designed for the audio revolution which I wrote about previously. It is built for people to be able to easily talk with friends in the Airpods world that many now live in. I have yet to actually use it but the concept is that you open the app and press a button to go online, at which point any of your friends with the app who are also online can see that you are online and you can see that they are and with the press of a button anyone can then join anyone else's line and form groups of up to eight people to chat. I would not be very surprised to see this catch on in a big way but the chances are against every startup at this stage so the burden will be on the founder(s) to make it work. I am looking forward to trying it out this week.\n\nBombshell \\- I watched this few months old movie about Fox which focused mostly on what was a busy year for Megyn Kelly and a final year for Roger Ailes. It had a star-studded cast led by Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie. The movie kept my attention and was somewhat eye-opening in terms of that year of events at Fox which I did not follow particularly closely as it developed in the news. This is not usually something that I would comment about but the makeup in this movie was pretty extraordinary as all of the actors were made to look almost exactly like the real-life people they were playing.\n\nThe week ahead projects to be a tough one for America and for the world at large. I am very appreciative of all the people who are working so hard and putting themselves and even their loved ones at risk to go above and beyond in their duties as I write this, and also for the countless others who are doing so many things to help. To keep a level head, I personally am focused on taking things one day at a time, being outside when it is nice out, exercising daily, and keeping a journal where I write for just a few minutes every morning about positive stuff and some of the things I am grateful for. I hope many of you can do some of the same to stay sane in these trying times which will pass."}]}

I was having steaks with my good friend and soon to be business partner, Kyle. Kyle and I transferred to Vanderbilt at the same time, were placed a few doors down from each other in an awful, mold-ridden dorm which we would both soon move out of (and which was knocked down by the time we graduated), and spent our first night on campus drinking whiskey together with another future friend of ours. Over the next few years, Kyle and I hung out a lot, studied together often and discussed a lot of business and investing ideas while procrastinating from said studies. This past year, a few months after the aforementioned dinner, we bought in 50/50 on a real estate investment, a multi-family duplex in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. I never imagined that I would become a Kentucky homeowner, but because of Kyle, now I am. Our investment is going very well so far and I am confident that Kyle and I will be doing a lot more together in the future, real estate or otherwise.\n\nGoing back to that dinner, over my ribeye and glass of wine and his filet and Coca-Cola, Kyle and I discussed where each of us were and where we wanted to be headed, in terms of our careers mostly as the majority time consumers of our lives in general. I was working as many hours as ever in investment banking and he had recently moved on from banking and into equity research. In discussing his decision to make the transition, he made a somewhat obvious point that I think tends to get overlooked and underestimated nonetheless, which is why I am choosing to write about it today. That is, he pointed out that we should be thinking about the value of our time in terms of hours rather than years.\n\nMost career-oriented jobs advertise salary to their prospective applicants. I used to think of my income in investment banking as a combination of salary and bonus because the latter comprises an unusually large percentage of most people’s overall annual income in the industry (i.e. the end of year bonuses are often more or less equal to annual salaries for top performers).\n\nAfter Kyle’s comment, I started to think about income more often in terms of dollars per hour. Think about the following hypothetical. All other things equal, would you rather work 80 hours per week for $100,000 or 40 hours per week for $75,000? The former pays $24 / hour and the latter pays $36 / hour. Most logical people would opt for the latter as the difference in the hourly rate is just too great. The decision would be more difficult however if the 40 hours per week job only paid $60,000. In that case, the income per hour of the 40 hours per week job ($29) would still be greater than that of the 80 hours per week job ($24), but the larger difference in annual salary becomes a bit more difficult of a pill to swallow ($100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000). I am not advocating for choosing one job over the other, even in this idealistic situation where everything else was somehow exactly equal, which of course in real life it would never be. I am simply advocating for people to more deliberately consider the time they expect to give in exchange for a salary when considering an offer.\n\nFurther on the hypothetical situation above, even if you were to take the 40 hour per week job at a salary of $75,000 and you are one of the increasingly popular breed of millennials who wants to work 80 hours per week still, that is totally fine. You can spend your time working on things that you are interested in and passionate about, invest your time in learning new skills and/or subjects, or if short-term income is your primary focus, get another part-time job or create your own side hustle for evenings and/or weekends. If you make more than $12 / hour for 40 additional hours of work, you would make more annually than the 80 hour per week job that paid $100,000. For comparison's sake, the much debated minimum wage for food service workers in New York City is $15 / hour...\n\nMoreover, as with most other things, when it comes to your free time, or disposable time as I prefer to call it, scarcity increases value. The less disposable time you have, the more precious it becomes, the more valuable it becomes. Think about it in extremes. If you had no disposable time (free time to do with what you wish), you would not be able to sleep at your own discretion (this is unfortunately a reality for some people who work long hour jobs or multiple jobs including night shifts). As such, most people would demand more money in exchange for working their 16th, 17th, and 18th hour of the day than the 4th, 5th, and 6th. They probably have at least six hours set aside to work anyway and will take what they can get in terms of income in exchange for that time. The 16th, 17th, and 18th hours on the other hand cut into the human necessity of sleep and for that reason they are very valuable. The same goes for the less extreme hours in between. There must be a gradual increase in the value of every hour between those two ranges of hours. The less disposable time you have, the more important are the things you have to cut for work such as time for meals with family or friends, time to go to the gym, time to read a book or watch TV, and time to just relax or enjoy your weekends.\n\nOf course, this point about considering income per hour rather than annual salary cannot be considered in a vacuum because there are a host of other related factors that are also important in making decisions around what to do for money. For example, if the day to day composition of your work includes a number of tasks, practices and activities that you like or even love doing or that you might be doing anyway if you had the freedom to choose what to do with your time, then you should be willing to accept less income in exchange for your time because there is less of a difference in the enjoyment or utility of what you have to do for that income versus what you might otherwise be doing.\n\nOnce in a while you hear people who love their jobs say things like \"I feel like I have never worked a day in my life\" or \"If money was not a thing, I would be doing exactly the same work that I am doing now\". Those people are mostly outliers and exceptions for now, but the optimist in me convinces the pragmatist that one day in the not too distant future it will become much more common as more menial tasks become automated and some form(s) of universal basic income increasingly provides people with more disposable income/time to live their lives as they please. In the meantime, most of us will continue to feel that we have to make some sort of trade off involving time for money. I suggest that we think about that trade-off in terms of hours as opposed to years. Forget salary."}]}

Others swear it's a scam. It's hard to use, confusing how it works, and it serves as a medium for nefarious activity. The creator is pseudonymous. It's called Bit-something. In the beginning, few have heard of it and far fewer care to learn more once they have. And yet, in hardly more than a decade, it grows to a market cap of over $1 Trillion. Of course, I am talking about Bitcoin.\n\nBitClout is not Bitcoin, obviously, but Bitcoin's story helps to demonstrate why it might be worth betting a small amount of money on this controversial new platform which looks like a type-writer text version of Twitter and which some believe is the decentralized social network that the crypto world has been waiting for. It seems like a joke. It could be a scam. It's hard to use, confusing how it works, and it serves as a medium for nefarious activity, but it could probably be worth $100 billion dollars in a few years, if not more, if not sooner.\n\n### BitClout's Biggest Issues\n\nBefore I explain briefly why I believe BitClout has enormous upside, let me address the three biggest issues which must be overcome in order to have any chance at achieving that upside. I summed them up in a tweet on April 7th:\n\nThe first and biggest issue right now is that there is no way to sell BitClout's native currency, also called BitClout. To be clear, a user must deposit Bitcoin (\"BTC\") in exchange for BitClout (\"BTCLT\") in order to use the platform and buy people's \"creator coins\", but there is currently no way to then convert BTCLT back to BTC or any other liquid cryptocurrency which one might in turn like to convert into dollars or another fiat currency of the like (foolish as that may be). This is obviously a significant issue so long as it persists, but it seems doubtful to me that it will. It is not uncommon for new crypto projects to begin with this bug (feature?), and while you certainly don't have to trust him, BitClout's pseudonymous creator Diamondhands told CoinDesk that it is only a matter of time before exchange is made possible.\n\nsource: [URL]\n\nThe second and third issues are irrelevant if the first and biggest one is never solved, but assuming that it will be, the next biggest issues from my perspective are the prevalence of \"fake\" accounts on BitClout and the v0 feeling platform which could lose its early lead to something cleaner and quicker. Again, these are issues that I would expect could be relatively easy to overcome.\n\nOn the fake accounts issue, it is easy to imagine the platform using Twitter as a verification method to start, though of course it would be ideal to find a way to do something independently eventually. In fact, BitClout is already using Twitter as a verification method for a select number of \"reserved\" accounts. In the case of these reserved accounts, the rightful owner (i.e. Elon Musk for the @elonmusk profile) has to tweet out their BitClout address in order to activate their BitClout account. The issue is that this verification process is only intact for those relatively few reserved accounts, so any other profile is free to be claimed by a phony pretender. This is why I am followed by people like Travis Kalanick and Marissa Meyer, both of whom you might not be surprised to see for an episode of my podcast, but whom I must confess did not actually follow me (the accounts in their name are clearly not actually them). Less fakes should make for more market cap, everything else being equal, and again, it shouldn't be a hard problem to solve.\n\nThe v0 platform is the least significant issue of the three. I don't actually mind the blocky, minimalist, mostly black and white aesthetic. What I mind is a loading time that is slower than any other website I use on the internet. Still, I am more than willing to put up with that lag time if it is the only way I can use a decentralized social media alternative that enables me create value for myself and for my followers, if that is in fact what BitClout proves to do.\n\n### The Bull Case For BitClout\n\nSo let me now close by addressing the upside and explaining why I am generally bullish on BitClout. To be clear, being bullish, the way that I use it at least, does not mean that I believe BitClout is certain to succeed. Far from it. In fact, I would estimate that there is a better than not chance that BitClout will be worth less in 3 years than it is today. Still, I am bullish in the sense that I believe it is worthwhile to invest a small amount of money that one is willing to lose in BitClout and some of the creator coins one can invest in using the platform. If BitClout is worth something that rounds to nothing in a few years, you could lose as much as all of the money that you invest, but if it is worth more than it is today, I would be hard-pressed to imagine that it would not be worth at least double, and more likely 10x or 100x as much. Simply put, I view an investment in BitClout as having degrees of magnitude more upside (10-100x) than downside (1x), an asymmetric bet with a reasonable probability of being successful. For that reason, it is a bet that I am willing to make.\n\nThe fundamental value proposition of the platform is one that I personally am excited about, whether BitClout is the one to best offer it in the long-term or not. I am excited about the ability for people to invest in people. I have been excited about this idea for a long time. Years ago, before I knew anything about crypto, I considered starting a company which would have taken a different angle at making this possible. I have never understood why I should be able to invest in companies, real estate, other assets, and now crypto, but not people. I've always thought I would be better at evaluating people than any of those other things. With BitClout, I might soon have an opportunity to prove it. For now, whether or not an investment on BitClout works out in the end will depend more on the fate of the platform than on one's ability to pick good people to invest in. That said, if and as BitClout becomes a fixture as the primary crypto social media platform, the decentralized Twitter of sorts, it will increasingly provide the opportunity for individuals to demonstrate their ability to identify other individuals whose value is poised to appreciate, to find them early, and to bet on them big.\n\nIt would be refreshing to finally have a social media platform where people can create value for themselves and for their supporters. Today, the monetary value goes not to the people but to the platform (i.e. Facebook or Twitter). You as the user are the product and the advertisers are the customers to which your data and attention are being sold. It's been overwhelmingly obvious for years that there must be a better way, and yet, no one has done it. Perhaps BitClout will never be perfect, but I for one would settle for better.\n\nLastly, I tend to outsource portions of diligence I can less easily comprehend. In other words, I am comfortable leaning on some social diligence where technical diligence may be beyond my scope. Secondarily, I have no qualms trusting some of my favorite investors, giving them the benefit of the doubt, and figuring that if it is good enough for them, it is good enough for me. These investors often have significantly more context and information than is available to the public, including maybe most importantly having usually had the opportunity to meet the team.\n\nIn this case, Diamondhands sent CoinDesk a list of BitClout's investors including \"Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Capital, TQ Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, Arrington Capital, Polychain, Pantera, Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company), Huobi, Variant and others.\" That is an impressive list to say the least.\n\nEarly people on the platform include Chamath Palihapitiya (who made his fortune helping grow the largest social network in the world (Facebook) and betting big and early on controversial investments like Tesla and Bitcoin), WhaleShark (the single best social token creator by far from my perspective), 3LAU (a previous podcast guest who is super smart on crypto and is revolutionizing the way artists get paid through NFTs), other smart people like the Winklevoss twins (also investors), Chris Dixon, and Ashton Kutcher, and many others, plus celebrities like Steve Aoki, Bella Thorne, and Pamela Anderson who could hint at the beginning of a broader hype cycle to begin BitClout's potentially short-lived or long-lasting life in the spotlight.\n\nThus far, the relatively small amount of time that I invested in writing this piece has been worth more than the amount of money I invested in BitClout. I invested a grand total of $94, all into my own creator coin \"blogofjake coin\", and that $94 is now evidently worth more than $2,000 according to BitClout. I say this so that you do not misunderstand me as saying I am all in on the platform or anything like that. I am simply sharing my perspective for whatever it is worth. Beyond writing this piece, I have hardly invested much of any time into BitClout either. I have merely been \"clouting\" a copy of whatever I tweet whenever I remember to do so. I may decide to invest more money (no more than I am willing to lose) into my creator coin, BTCLT generically, and/or the creator coins of others, but as of now, that is all that I have done.\n\nThis is not investment advice. This is just what I think about BitClout. You can follow me @blogofjake."}]}

Unfortunately, there are and will continue to be many more of those people than usual as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic impact that is costing tens of millions of Americans their jobs. This sudden loss of income for masses of people is especially concerning when paired with the fact that, according to the Federal Reserve, about 40% of Americans would struggle to cover an unexpected expense of just $400. Obviously, this hypothetical unexpected expense of $400 does not come close to equating with the unexpected loss of one's entire income that has become the reality for people all across America. I wrote about the eleven human needs earlier this week and I started this fundraiser because I am concerned that many people will struggle to satisfy them now, specifically by not being able to afford enough food. You can visit the official website here:\n\nIf and when you do, please take a minute to read the full fundraiser description to learn more about what exactly you can do to help.\n\nLastly, I understand and am humbled by the fact that I am writing to an audience that is much more global than I would have expected it to be at this point when I first started writing last December. I encourage those from other countries to focus on the problems hitting closest to home, and for any Americans with higher priority issues, I encourage them to do the same. If you do care about this cause in particular, however, or if you would just like to run, walk, help fundraise or donate to support a great cause, your efforts will by no means be taken for granted.\n\nThank you sincerely for anything you can do to help."}]}

The question of “how?” then becomes all important.\n\nIn aiming to answer this question, I will draw on previous descriptions of four different kinds of luck which originated from a book called Chase, Chance, and Creativity by Dr. James Austin. These were organized and opined upon in a blog post by Marc Andreessen and also later synthesized by Naval Ravikant. These four different kinds of luck, as Naval most succinctly defines them, are (1.) Blind Luck, (2.) Luck from Hustling, (3.) Luck from Preparation, and (4.) Luck from your Unique Character.\n\nI have no issues with these denominations which are consistent with the descriptions of each kind of luck as they were laid out by Andreessen and originally presented in the book. Still, I would like to approach these kinds of luck through a slightly different, and perhaps even simpler framework. Fundamentally, I believe there are two primary means by which one can get more lucky more often, to “make your own luck”, as they say. I also believe both means can be worked at and improved, which makes them worth thinking about. Simply stated, I believe the two ways to a luckier life are (1.) to find more luck and (2.) to help more luck find you.\n\nNaturally, one might wonder what this means exactly, to find luck and to help luck find you. To be more specific, let us come back to the four kinds of luck as they were previously defined. My contention is that #1 (Blind Luck) and #3 (Luck from Preparation) fall into the category of “finding luck” while #2 (Luck from Hustling) and #4 (Luck from your Unique Character) fall into the category of “helping luck find you”. If you can agree with this categorization, or at least give me the benefit of the doubt so as to hear me out, the question becomes how you can find luck and help luck find you.\n\nLet us begin with the first part, finding luck. In introducing the third kind of luck which Naval calls “luck from preparation”, Dr. Austin says, “we see blind luck, but it tiptoes in softly, dressed in camouflage.” One could easily substitute the word “find” instead of “see” in front of “blind” and argue that Dr. Austin might agree with my contention that this third kind of luck is all about getting better at finding the first kind, which is blind.\n\nThe question of how to find luck is really about how we can go from being blind to seeing, or from aimlessly searching to inevitably finding. We need to improve our vision, figuratively speaking, or more aptly, our awareness. We need to become better finders, identifiers, and recognizers of luck. As the countless events of life fly past us all day every day, we must be able to see clearly the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity disguised as just another ordinary occurrence. I might even go so far as to argue that these kinds of incredible opportunities and extremely “lucky” breaks are in fact far more frequent than once in a lifetime, but that the average person depending purely on blind luck might only expect to stumble upon one per lifetime, if they are lucky (blindly, that is).\n\nIt is important to recognize that we can increase our luck by improving our ability to find it. Naval’s naming of the third kind of luck implies that this can be done through preparation. Louis Pasteur seemed to agree when he said, “Chance favors the prepared mind.” The Roman stoic Seneca similarly said, “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” I would propose that we augment this focus on preparation with a complementary focus on awareness – for what use is there in being prepared if one fails to see the opportunity as it presents itself?\n\nThe prepared and aware person is well equipped to identify a lucky break when it presents itself so that he or she may capitalize on the recognized opportunity. This may look like blind luck to others in retrospect, or even to the seizers of luck themselves, but the reality is that most people in the position of the “lucky” person would not have recognized the “lucky” opportunity when it presented itself. Controversially perhaps, I would argue that most everyone has at least some small number of relatively lucky breaks come their way, but the people who are prepared and aware are much better at finding and consequently seizing those opportunities as they come to pass.\n\nA lucky break can even be devilishly disguised as a disappointment. For example, let us consider a hypothetical story in which a young woman named Lucy applies for a job at a company she's interested in. After her interviews, the recruiter informs Lucy that, “unfortunately”, they have decided to hire somebody else for the position. As almost an afterthought, the recruiter offers to introduce Lucy to her cousin who is looking for someone with similar qualifications for his new company on the other side of town. The recruiter mentions this opportunity to Lucy because she came to like her from their limited interactions and so she also warns her transparently that her cousin’s company would not be able to pay her nearly as much because it is only just getting started and even her cousin is practically working for free.\n\nIn this situation, a person with a close-minded lack of awareness who is focused squarely on getting a good salary may default to passing on the opportunity without more than a moment’s thought. The positive, open-minded, and aware person, on the other hand, knows that she will get lucky and that it is her job to recognize it when it happens. She appreciates that the most amazing opportunities can be hidden in the most unlikely of places. Fortunately, Lucy is exactly this kind of person.\n\nShe asks a simple follow-up question, ”what do they do?”. “They are working on these things called personal computers,” the recruiter responds, “I don’t know much about them but they need some help with sales.” By total chance (or maybe not), Lucy is great at sales and remembers one of the smartest people at her old job left recently to join some company to work on these things called personal computers. Lucy reckons it could be an interesting opportunity worth exploring and after one thing leads to the next she gets an offer to become the 13th employee at Apple Computer.\n\nIt is far from obvious that this company will be successful but her conversations with the team left her excited and she sees a lot of potential and relatively little downside for herself even if the company fails. Lucy accepts the offer and goes on to become extremely wealthy as an early employee at Apple. When she tells her story many years later, she doesn’t get into too many of the details. She just says she got lucky.\n\nThe truth is that Lucy’s awareness combined with her preparedness, her open-mindedness to explore a seemingly fruitless opportunity presented in the context of “unfortunate” news, and her ability to recall and connect the brilliant employee who left her old company to pursue personal computers allowed her to find this opportunity, to find what one might see as “blind luck”, and to seize it.\n\nBut there is another side of the luck equation, as I mentioned previously. If total luck is the product of x and y, and if x is the percentage of “lucky” opportunities that one is able to find, then y is the total number of “lucky” opportunities that come to pass, whether one identifies them as such or not. As illustrated in the story above, it is very important that one equips oneself so that they may find luck, but it may be even more important that one gets good at helping luck find them. The person who is excellent at finding luck but awful at helping luck find them may find 2 out of 3 “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunities in life, but the person who is excellent at helping luck find them may have one hundred “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunities, and even if they are much worse at finding luck and are only able to identify 10% of their chances, they’ll still seize 10 once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. That's 5x as many as the person who is great at finding luck but not at helping luck find them.\n\nTo consider how one can help luck find them, let us refer back once more to the four previously defined kinds of luck. Helping luck find you is about what Naval calls “luck from hustling” (#2) and “luck from your unique character” (#4). The first way to help luck find you, luck from hustling, is a bit easier to describe than the second so let's start there. What Naval calls “hustling”, many call “hard work”. I will call it “persistent action”, but whichever definition helps you think about it should work mostly the same.\n\nThe reason I call it persistent action is because hard work often implies misery and hustling often implies struggling but I believe that the thing which needs to be done in this dimension to help luck find you can come from a more positive perspective. I use the term \"persistent action\" because I believe the opportunities come as a direct result of your actions, the things you do. That does not necessarily mean it has to be hard or that you have to struggle, although you may, but the degree of difficult or severity of struggle should not be confused as the determining factor for bringing luck, which is simply the sum of your actions themselves.\n\nThe persistent action is what brings the “lucky” opportunities. In the words of Charles Kettering, just “keep on going and the chances are you will stumble upon something, perhaps when you are least expecting it. I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down.” Still, many others do prefer to use the simple phrase of hard work to convey what I believe is mostly the same assertion. Samuel Goldwyn famously said, “The harder I work, the luckier I get.” Thomas Jefferson said similarly, “I’m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the luckier I get.”\n\nWithout worrying at all about finding luck, or the next method of helping luck find you which I will introduce, it seems that persistent action alone, relentlessness in a sense, may be enough to guarantee some degree of success. The reason [URL] brings you to the Amazon homepage is because that was Jeff Bezos’ original name for the company. The list of examples of people who believed something like hard work, persistent action, hustle, or relentlessness could make them lucky and proved successful in the end is endless. If you remember nothing else from this essay, remember that.\n\nBeyond hard work, persistent action, or whatever else one might call it, there is a second means by which one can help luck find them. Naval calls this “luck from your unique character”. To be truly unique, one must by definition have no competition. Naval shares relevant wisdom here too when he says, “Escape competition through authenticity.” In other words, no one can compete with you at being you. Perhaps then we could rename this fourth kind of luck, “luck from authenticity.”\n\nStill, it seems intuitive that neither unique character nor authenticity alone is enough. There must be some additional component. What can it possibly matter if one is authentic if no one ever comes across their authenticity or the unique character that is reflected by it?\n\nI would argue that the world does not care if you are authentic or unique, but people do. Thus, one must expose their unique character to people in order to get lucky, and the more people they are exposed to, all else equal, the luckier they should get. If your unique character is the product, your exposure is your sales. The inherent value of the best and most unique product in the world is wasted if no one is ever to discover it.\n\nSo the key to helping luck find you is to be authentic in public. The ideal would be to demonstrate your unique character in a place everyone can see so that anyone may discover you. This place, of course, does not exist in the physical world. But I would argue that does exist. It is the most public place in the world. It's the internet.\n\nCould it be that being authentic on the internet, where anyone can find you, is the ultimate way to help luck find you too? Could it be that the internet innovated on luck itself by giving people a tool for helping more of it find them for the same amount of effort? Could it be because of luck, in a different way than some would suggest, that the main websites for finding products (Amazon), people (Facebook), and generally anything (Google) are three of the 5 most valuable companies in the world, and the companies that make the devices and systems we use to access those websites (Apple and Microsoft) are the other two? Perhaps the web of companies tying together the web (the internet) are the most companies valuable in the world not because they themselves got lucky, but because they are increasing the total amount of luck that comes to fruition in the world, or perhaps this is too farfetched.\n\nEither way, I will conclude this contemplation on luck as I so often do by reflecting on my own personal experience. I have committed to a life full of learning so that I may become increasingly prepared. I have aimed to maintain open-mindedness and a positive perspective so I may be aware. And I have worked hard and acted persistently. I will continue to do all of these things. I have also embraced a unique path and I have been authentic in public, writing blogs and sharing podcasts for anyone with internet access to discover. I am writing and I am sharing this which may bring me luck too. In short, I have combined awareness and preparedness with persistent action and I am being authentic in public. All of these efforts, I believe, will help me find luck and help luck find me. I suppose the validation of this piece will be determined by how lucky I get in the end, if “luck” is what you want to call it."}]}

It was Muhammad Ali who once said, “Don’t count the days. Make the days count.”\n\nI do not remember where I was when I first learned that Muhammad Ali died, but I do distinctly remember seeing the news on the cover of a paper in a yellow newspaper box on the streets of San Francisco in the summer of 2016. It was while taking some time to watch old videos and read about the “The Greatest” after his death that I discovered the quote. I have never been one to put inspirational quotes up around my desk, but that summer I wrote Ali’s words on my mousepad so that I would remember every day not to count the days but to make them count.\n\nCounting down the days until the weekend is a widely accepted norm. Most people do it some of the time and some people do it most of the time. Over the course of my life, I have certainly been no exception. People count down the time until other things as well, like the number of days until summer as a kid, or Thanksgiving and the extended break from work that comes with it, or Christmas, vacation, a birthday, or retirement.\n\nIt is totally fine to look forward to things. In fact, I think life benefits from a sense of excitement in thinking about the future, but not at the expense of spending the interim with a “get through” attitude in which one is simply counting down the days, wishing they were going by faster, or worst of all, complaining that they are not going by fast enough.\n\nIt should seem obvious that counting down the days is not a good way to live, but still, most of us do it anyway. Why? Because we do not feel that we have a choice. To be fair, sometimes we may not, but most of the time we do. Most of the time, we simply prioritize certain things more highly. We want things more than we want not to count the days. We do not like changes, especially when they carry a lot of unknown and would not be guaranteed to change the fact that we are counting down the days in the first place. We get tired of thinking about the things that we could change to solve the problem because it is a hard problem to solve and most everyone else is dealing with it so we can deal with it too, we reason. We find some satisfactory justification for counting down the days without feeling bad about it or at least an excuse to stop thinking about doing something to change it. In doing so, we can usually kick the can down the road and put the problem off another few weeks or months or years until eventually we get so accustomed to counting down the days that the alternative becomes too foreign to even imagine anymore. It becomes only a dream we once had. This, of course, is speculative on my part. I am too young to have had all of that happen and unfold in my life personally, but that is how I could imagine things might play out. I hope and trust that they will not play out that way for me.\n\nInstead of living of a life in which we are counting down the days and putting off doing anything to change that, I would argue that we should take action when, for too many days, for too long a time, we find ourself counting down the days. If we cannot change our thinking in our current circumstances, which we may well be able to do, then we need to change our circumstances in whatever ways we can, small or large.\n\nDays are simply a unit of time, and a useful one to think about since it is about as natural as they come with the rising and setting of the sun. After a certain number of sunrises and sunsets, we all die eventually, and the question of whether we would like to count down the days until then, or to make them count, seems to be one with an obvious answer.\n\nI know when I am making my days count because I feel like there is not enough time in the day, not to do the things that I have to do or the things that make me feel stressed or negative, but to do the things that I want to do, the things that make me feel purpose or pleasure or positive.\n\nTo me, Muhammad Ali shared with us a fundamental way to go about our days, and for that I am grateful to The Greatest. I am far from perfect at it, but generally I do my best not to count the days and to make the days count. At a time like this, it is especially easy to fall into the trap of counting down the days, to the end of this month when social distancing guidelines are in effect in the US, or to a fictitious future when everything will suddenly go back to normal. There may be nothing worse to count the days until than a miracle.\n\nSome days are flat out bad and sometimes those days can stretch to weeks and months and during those times it is much harder to make the days count and much easier to remember that the worst times get better. That is okay too. But if you think about your circumstances and cannot think of a way to explain them to someone in which they would feel sorry for you, then this is probably as good a time as any to start thinking about what you can do to make your days count instead of counting them, and to do it."}]}

My family calls her Mom-mom.\n\nI heard from my mother that Mom-mom was planning to go to the grocery store to get a few things, so I called Mom-mom again yesterday to ask her what she needed. I told her that I could order it to be delivered to her doorstep instead. I told her I wanted to do that.\n\nMom-mom lives in Florida. She is 85 years old. She told me on Sunday that she had never seen anything like this and it all really felt like a movie. She had also never seen anything like grocery delivery service through Amazon, and I could hardly get her to tell me anything she needed from the store. I have found that one of the ways in which I am most different from most people is that I make an effort to welcome and even seek change because change is the only constant and it is the means by which we grow. The human tendency, however, (and my natural inclination is no different) is to fear change, to resist it, to avoid it all costs. That is why a lot of people are refusing to comply with social distancing until they are forced to do so by law or by closure of the place they usually go. That is also why Mom-mom just wanted to go to the grocery store, because that is what she always does.\n\nStill, I managed to get her to tell me that she eats eggs and cooks pasta and uses almond milk. We agreed I would wait to hear from her tomorrow after she went to the store in case she could not get anything there, but I thought I could change her mind if I showed her what was possible. I ordered the three things that she mentioned and some chocolate (the one other thing I knew she would eat) from Whole Foods on Amazon at 3:01pm yesterday. The package was delivered at 5:02pm.\n\nIn the midst of all this madness, I am truly amazed by Amazon. They made a 2 hour and 1 minute delivery from order click to delivery confirmation during a global pandemic when the company is well into uncharted territory in terms of its demand. I acted unimpressed when Mom-mom called me to tell me I fooled her and that she got the food because I wanted her to think it was all no big deal nowadays so that she would accept it moving forward instead of going out. The fact of the matter, however, is that it is a big deal. The reality is that it is not normal. What Amazon did yesterday, what it is doing today, and what it will do again tomorrow and the next day and the next day could not have been done at this scale with this speed in this crazy environment at any other time in the history of the world.\n\nIt is for reasons like this that I cannot be convinced that all technology is all bad, or that the big companies are all evil, or that the people who run them are all greedy and ill-willed. They may not be perfect, nobody is, but many of them are doing what they can to build what they believe will be a better world, and many of them, like Amazon, have done an unbelievable job. Whenever I decide to dip back into the stock market, Amazon is the first company that I will buy a share in. There are a lot of people and a lot of companies that are doing amazing things in the face of adversity. All of them deserve appreciation.\n\nI am thankful for Amazon today."}]}

I am going to focus on the first event because the second is relatively inconsequential from my perspective and the third simply marks the end of a process that most people have known would be inconsequential from the onset (at least in terms of its main objective to remove Trump from The White House).\n\nWe still do not have the final results from the Iowa Caucus, nor do we have a declared winner, but it seems to be between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders for the #1 spot, followed by Elizabeth Warren at #3 and Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar surprisingly close at #4 and #5 respectively with 71% of precincts reported. Typically, the complete results are announced the night of the caucus, which took place on Monday. That said, it has now been almost 48 hours and we still do not have the results because of a broken app that was intended to assist precinct leaders with reporting combined with the ineffectiveness of the phone lines that were supposed to serve as a backup for the app. The whole situation is a bit of a nightmare, especially in a national environment where people are increasingly mistrusting of institutions and authorities, skeptical of both the effectiveness and security of our democratic process, and hypersensitive to the truth or lack thereof behind much of the information that the public receives. Nonetheless, while we do not have a declared winner, we do have enough information to determine a handful of overall winners from this losing situation. Below are brief descriptions for the most notable five of them, in no particular order.\n\nMike Bloomberg took a risk by declaring his run for president after the date by which he would have needed to announce to be on the ballot for the initial caucuses and primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. He then doubled down by imploring the other Democrats in the race to focus more on the battleground states for the general election instead of the first states for the Democratic Primary. This mess in Iowa has to be a plus for his campaign. It is also worth mentioning that Bloomberg's odds will increase dramatically if Biden falls early and the party turns to the elder mayor as the best centrist alternative to Bernie (or Warren if she were to somehow surge past him which I view as very doubtful). An unforeseeable and totally botched process with Pete beating Bernie for #1 and Klobuchar beating Biden for #4 would be a better outcome in Iowa than Bloomberg could have reasonably hoped for.\n\nPete Buttigieg may very well win the Iowa Caucus, and while he was projected to fair strongly in the state, I think most projections including FiveThirtyEight had him finishing third behind Bernie and Biden in first and second in either order. I do not think Pete is capable of beating Bloomberg for the less left vote among Democrats, but it appears he was very capable of dealing Biden a strong early blow that could lead to his eventual knockout. I personally believe it will come down to Bernie and/or Bloomberg to face Trump for the presidency, but if Pete does end up coming out on top in Iowa, he is my distant third pick. Then again, he was most people's distant third pick for Iowa too.\n\nBernie Sanders will now be the heavy favorite for the nomination regardless of whether he finishes first or second in Iowa with Biden having had the really poor showing that he did and Warren finishing materially below him as well. Bernie is projected to win in New Hampshire next and Nevada after that and if Biden continues to struggle in those states then a win in South Carolina may no longer be a foregone conclusion. I am still a bit concerned about Bernie physically after the heart attack that voters have seemed to forget about surprisingly quickly, but politically Bernie seems to be in very good shape.\n\nDonald Trump benefits from any situation that objectively looks bad for the Democratic Party. This was one of those situations, as was Nancy Pelosi's literally ripping his speech at the State of the Union Address, but in the bigger picture the delay of the Iowa Caucus results should not be of material significance come election time. The results themselves however will of course impact the determination of who Trump will be running against and in that regard it seems much less likely that candidate will be Biden today than it did a week ago. I will not speculate as to whether that is a plus or a minus for Trump's re-election bid, but if he would rather have faced Biden than Sanders or Bloomberg then it was not all good news out of Iowa for The President.\n\nAmy Klobuchar is neck and neck with Joe Biden based on what has been reported so far and if anyone tells you they predicted that I would not believe them without written proof. I said in a previous post that Klobuchar does not have a chance and this result does not change that but it is impressive nonetheless and rightly demands some acknowledgement and respect.\n\nHonorable Mention should be made of Elizabeth Warren who had a stronger than expected turnout, Andrew Yang who no one expected to be here at all, and the state of New Hampshire which most likely is going to look great so long as it goes more smoothly than Iowa, which I hope it does.\n\nIronically, my only experience in Iowa led me to be impressed by the state's technology and reporting mechanisms, though the story involved a better group of former candidates for president. My buddy Will and I and our other friend Cam were on route to Mount Rushmore as part of a two-week roadtrip after graduation when we made a pit stop for dinner in Iowa before a night's stay in Sioux Falls. My burger was just a bit better than alright, but I remember clearly observing that the on-table computer systems for placing our orders were phenomenal and surprisingly better than most similar technologies I had seen in cities like Nashville, San Francisco, and New York. It is unfortunate that Iowa's evident technological prowess as I observed it did not show well on Monday."}]}

You pick it up, dip it fish-side down in the soy sauce, and put it fish-side down in your mouth.

These things include exercise, fasting, and nutrition. Within the next decade or two, I believe there will be several more things that people can do to add many more. Until those things come, here is what I do:\n\nI run 3 or more miles 5 days per week. I fast for 16 hours every weekday from after dinner the night before until after noon that day. I practice a gluten-free vegan diet on weekdays.\n\nI don’t take any pills for anything on a regular basis but there are two that I would try if I was older. I would take 1 gram of metformin and Basis, an NAD+ supplement by Elysium. I do take a daily vitamin from Nutrametrix which is a powder that is soluble in water. Neither brand is paying for this mention.\n\nThe other things that may help me live a longer and healthier life are not things that I do but rather things that I do not do. I do not consume too much alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, or other drugs (although some damage might have already been done in the first department). I do not have conviction that any of these things are especially bad for healthy longevity but I presume them all to be better in moderation.\n\nMy habits are far from perfect but they are healthy enough that I expect to live a longer and healthier life than most if I stay the course. I could still be struck by lightning this afternoon or face something fatal that is far less improbable, but even if these practices do not guarantee me a longer and healthier life, all else equal, a healthier life is a happier one."}]}

One is for humans and one is for animals.\n\nThe philosophical definition for humans characterizes an action as altruistic if it is done with the selfless and conscious intention of benefiting another human's well-being. The biological definition for animals is slightly but crucially less demanding. It does not involve moral highness nor is it concerned with the altruistic actor's intentions. Instead, it is the consequences of the action alone that determine whether that action is altruistic.\n\nSpecifically, altruistic acts in the animal kingdom must increase the reproductive fitness of the species. In other words, it is a means by which individual animals can increase the success of their own genes by furthering the prosperity of their own species. It may be selfless of the animal or it may not be. It does not matter what the animal's intention is. Other animals are not going to call them out on social media for having selfish intentions disguised as selfless acts. To act altruistically, an animal simply needs to do something that will increase the success of their genes and of their species. In biology, that is enough.\n\nI believe we should be less demanding when it comes to judging human actions of altruism as well. We are animals, after all. We should judge actions less on intentions and more on results. We should ask what the impact of people's actions are on other people, not what their intentions are in doing it. Setting a lower, more reasonable, and more objectively possible bar for altruistic action should theoretically increase the frequency of its occurrence. People would be less concerned with being judged negatively for trying to do something good. As a result, they would do good things more often.\n\nPeople are judged negatively for trying to do good all of the time. I worked at the local Boys & Girls Club during the second semester of my senior year as part of a capstone program from my major in human and organizational development. My boss at the time opened my eyes to an unfortunate phenomonen that existed in the non-profit world. There is a great TED talk on the topic by Dan Pallotta. The short version is that non-profit employees do not get paid enough. The longer version is that they do not get paid enough because their organizations are judged heavily (and counterproductively) by the percentage of total donated funds that go directly to the cause as opposed to administration and overhead. Paying people less draws lower quality talent. This is intuitive. Yet we expect non-profit employees not only to do good through their work but also to take a pay cut on what they could earn elsewhere in order to do it. That seems unreasonable to me. We should judge non-profits on their total impact, not on what percentage of the money they raise goes directly to the cause. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former CEO of Save the Children, was paid $309,524.12 in 2018. People working in finance, tech, and many other industries can earn higher salaries than that before they turn 30. If anything, we should be paying non-profit employees more than they could earn in other industries. That way, we would incentivize the smartest people in the world to work on solving the biggest problems in the world and helping the people who need it most.\n\nYesterday, The New York Times reported on the story of Shake Shack returning a $10 million loan that it received from the recently enacted federal Paycheck Protection Program. In his public announcement regarding this return, Shake Shack's CEO wrote about why they applied for the loan and how Shake Shack is burning $1.5 million per week. After applying for the forgivable loan, they were able to raise $150 million through a public stock offering. As a result, they have decided they are now financially comfortable enough to return the loan so that it can go to businesses that need it more than they do. Now, instead of money, Shake Shack gets good press, or at least less bad press, and that translates to more customers buying more burgers, and in the end, it is all money. Because of this, few will look at their latest action as altruistic. Still, they were awarded the $10 million and chose to return it after their circumstances changed. That $10 million will go on to help another struggling business or more likely several of them. It was not perfect philosophical altruism, but the positive impact makes it a positive action from my perspective, and altruistic in terms of the animal standard.\n\nUnlike Shake Shack, many companies did not apply for the PPP loans. They may not have done so for a variety of reasons. They might have shared publicly why they did not apply for it or they might have kept it totally a secret. The ones who share publicly could be accused of not applying for the same reason that Shake Shack could be accused of returning the money, to gain good press, goodwill, and money in the end. It is harder to criticize the companies that did not apply and kept that fact a secret but they might have had their own reasons for their actions as well, and who is to say what their exact intentions were. At the very least, the leaders of those companies probably feel good about what they did. Is that alone too selfish to make it an act of altruism?\n\nAnalyses of intentions and accusations of self-benefits seem irrelevant and counterproductive. I do not care how some person or organization benefits from doing good. I am just glad they are doing it. In fact, I would argue that similarly to the low pay problem in non-profits, limiting the benefits that the people and organizations doing the good can experience limits the amount of good that they can do. In the above example for instance, the company that keeps their non-application a secret seems more altruistic than the one that shares why they did what they did, but the latter may encourage other businesses that are less in need to do the same, whereas the former could not multiply their impact by staying silent.\n\nOften times, we get out what we put in and we benefit from doing good. Forget about pure altruism. It can always be questioned and critiqued. Let us accept the biological definition of altruism instead. Let us focus more on results than intentions. Let us applaud those who do things that benefit the human race and let us encourage others to do the same. Let us do those things ourselves without worrying what others will think. If we all do good for each other, does it really matter why?"}]}

As with all questions, the answer is far from black and white. The question itself is inherently flawed. \n\nThat is because the question implies that:\n\n   It is possible to identify things with certainty as objectively better or worse\n\n   The things you want to do and the things you’ll be glad you did are mutually exclusive\n\n   You can always know the things you’ll be glad you did before you do them\n\n\n\n\nNone of these are necessarily true and so I recognize this question I have considered is an imperfect one with an imperfect answer. Still, it has led me to the creation of a useful framework for thinking about what to do whenever there is any doubt.\n\nLet me begin by defining the two situations in which there is no doubt about what to do or not to do.\n\n   When there is something that you want to do and you know or believe you will be glad you did later, you will generally do that thing without any hesitation.\n\n  * When there is something you do not want to do and you do not know or believe you will be glad you did later, you will generally not do that thing nor give it any further consideration.\n\n\n\n\nThe two situations described above represent opposite ends of the want to do / glad you did it spectrum in which both or neither of these primary reasons one would do something are satisfied. These situations are easy to navigate intuitively if not subconsciously so I will not waste another word on them herein.\n\nThe more interesting situations arise when the two reasons to do something (because you want to do it or will be glad you did) are either opposite or ambiguous. I would argue that there are 5 kinds of these situations in total. Those 5 kinds of situations are summarized as follows:\n\n  1. When you don’t want to do the thing but think you’ll be glad you did it. (i.e. exercise)\n\n  2. When you want to do the thing but think you’ll regret that you did it. (i.e. vices)\n\n  3. When you don’t know if you want to do the thing\n\n  4. When you don’t know if you’ll be glad you did the thing\n\n  5. When you don’t know if you want to do the thing or if you’ll be glad you did the thing\n\n\n\n\nMy proposition is that anything that one would consider doing should fall into one of these handful of buckets and that there are simple ways to approach these seemingly trickier situations once you identify which bucket they are in.\n\nIn the first instance, you should do the thing unless you really really don’t want to. Even then, sometimes you still should. You know you’ll be glad you did it.\n\nIn the second instance, you shouldn’t do the thing unless you really really want to. Even then, sometimes you still shouldn’t. You know you will regret it.\n\nIn next two instances which each involve one ambiguous aspect, decide based on the positivity or negativity of the other aspect (the unambiguous one).\n\nThe last instance may be the most common, especially for people who tend to dwell on the question of what to do. The strategic approach for what to do in this instance should come as a relief. In fact, it does not very much matter what you do in this double ambiguous instance. If you don’t know whether you want to do something or not and you don’t know whether you’ll be glad you did the thing or regret it, chances are you won’t be that glad or regretful either way, and if you don’t particularly want or not want to do it, then you don’t really care. It doesn’t really matter. The only wrong choice really is to dwell on this choice because you do not care about it and it does not matter. Just do it or don’t. \n\nAll but the last of the five scenarios described above end up looking like 70/30 decisions. The last one seems more like a 51/49. With good judgment and a sound framework, all of them can be made into quick and easy decisions about what to do or not to do.\n\nIdentify the bucket. Apply the approach. Just do it, or don’t."}]}

Today, the markets are up because history says the worst weeks are followed by good weeks, except when they are not (2008). Most everyone is hoping the spring comes faster and the coronavirus spreads slower, despite what DJT Jr. said.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nLil Frankie's \\- went here Thursday night with my brother and two cousins. It is a cool if not crammed Italian spot on 1st and 1st. Luckily we had some space in the back corner. I would recommend the lemon spaghetti, gnocchi, and pizza. The eggplant appetizer was a try and fail as I thought I was going to have some familiar help but did not. When the large wholly baked eggplant arrived at the table to be cut open, drizzled with olive oil, and sprinkled with seasoning, I realized that nobody wanted to try it but me. I did a respectable job and it was reasonably tasty but I am not in the business of eating whole eggplants, especially not when there are pizza and pastas on deck.\n\nThe Big Sick \\- finally got around to watching this movie with Lauren over the weekend. I thought it was good and well acted by Kumail Nanjiani who is now jacked, Ray Romano who is now back, Zoe Kazan who plays Kumail's real-life wife Emily, and her mother in the movie who Lauren sniped as the voice of Elastigirl in The Incredibles. The movie was not incredible, but it was well worth a watch.\n\nViolet \\- went to this months-old East Village spot from the owners of Emmy Squared and Emily with Lauren on Friday night and split an outrageously good \"grilled\" pizza and a burger. The pizza dough was grilled on both sides as advertised with fontina, truffle sottocenere (fancy cheese), pistachios, and honey on top. It was as much cheesy bread as it was pizza but it was absolutely delicious. They give us a big pair of scissors to cut it with which may be fun for some people but I would have been fine if they saved us the step. The burger which we ordered medium came out objectively rare but it was still very tasty with caramelized mushrooms, cheese, and bacon. It is easy enough with a steak or a fish to send it back if they get it wrong to be cooked some more. With a burger, however, the kitchen really has one shot to get it right because once it is all done up with the toppings and everything it really has to be a problem to become worthwhile making a fuss about. We ate it as it was and that got me the rarer part of Lauren's half so I had no complaints and would go back for the pizza alone.\n\nPasquale Jones \\- known to have some of the best pizza in the city, I made a Saturday brunch reservation for 4 when I found out my buddy Jack who I worked with out in San Francisco was going to be in town up from DC for the weekend. We split a bottle of red, a salad, and a bowl of agnolotti (small ravioli) as a table. Jack and Sam split a spicy pepperoni pizza and Lauren and I split one with mushrooms. The pizza was great as expected but the waiter's expressed certainty in the fact that it was the best pizza in New York was a bit off-putting to me. There is a sense of humility that I believe can be an important element in being the best, so if someone says they are the best, they probably are not, not in my book at least, most of the time. I liked the music very much from Jurassic 5 when we walked in to Big L when I used the bathroom and even the lesser known People Under The Stairs later on in the meal. We talked about Kobe, San Francisco, and the concept of destiny.\n\nFamily Sunday - my parents came in on Sunday for brunch with Sam and I and to see our apartment for the first time. We met them at The Crosby Hotel which was a bit artsy and posh for my usual taste but a great spot for family brunch nonetheless. We ended up hanging out through the afternoon and had a bonus meal in the form dinner at Lupa, which is one of my very favorite places for pasta in all of New York. We split the cacio pepe and the short rib ragu along with a chicken dish which looked good enough at the table next to us to convince us to stray from strictly pastas.\n\nToday is the first day of No Meat Week for me, and maybe the first or second day for you too. Thankfully, I had plenty of great meals this weekend to last me through the next several days on smoothies, rice, beans, frozen bags of vegetables, and all of the other boring but indubitably healthy groceries that I eat during the week. I am conscious of the fact that after only three posts of the The Weekend Miscellaneous it has pretty clearly become a food and sometimes movie review outlet. I believe this may morph over time, and I may sooner or later do away with The Weekend Miscellaneous altogether, but for now, like everything else that I write, I hope some people can find some way in which it is useful and/or enjoyable, just as it is for me."}]}

I declared the first full week of March 2020 No Meat Week, and even if no one else was going to do it with me, I wrote that I would not be eating any meat that week.\n\nThe first full week of March is now upon us and I could have never foreseen at that time how totally prepared I would be. I had no idea at the time, but several weeks after that post, following a visit to the vegan capital of the world (Tel Aviv) and a few other small and somewhat synchronous happenings, I began experimenting with the weekday gluten-free vegan diet that I first introduced in this post, provided an update on in this one, and have now practiced for the last seven weeks without any signs of stopping.\n\nI generally believe that people do not experiment with things nearly as much as they should. If we never try things, how are we ever supposed to know what they are like? In the spirit of experimentation, I would be honored if you would join me in recognizing No Meat Week and making this one week commitment to a meatless diet. You don't have to go full vegan mode (cutting milk, eggs, etc.). You can have a cheat meal or two if you need. You can do Sunday through Saturday like I will be doing or Monday through Sunday if you prefer. You can even just do the five weekdays if you like, the way I have been doing for the last several weeks which I have found to be very sustainable. Regardless, I wish you the best of luck if you try it and would be glad to hear from you via email if you do. Tell a friend to tell a friend. Even if it is only to find out that you are never going to eat a meatless meal again, I think you will find it to be a worthwhile experiment.\n\nHave a nice weekend and treat yourself to some good eats ahead of this week without meats."}]}

It teaches us to admire a person's competitive drive. That is a trap.\n\nPeter Thiel co-founded Paypal in 1998 and has since become a famous venture capitalist. Scott Adams created the Dilbert comic strip. Scott does not sound as rich as Peter. He is not. Still, his estimated net worth of $75 million, unlike his comics, is nothing to laugh at.\n\nPeter has been quoted many times saying, \"competition is for losers.\" I believe he is right.\n\nThink about the NFL for example. Every season, 32 teams compete for the ultimate goal of winning the Super Bowl. Every season, there are 31 losers and 1 winner. Usually it is the Patriots. Hopefully that is over now.\n\nThink about the players. NCAA data showed that in a given year 73,712 out of over 1 million high school football players went on to play in college. Just 254 of them are drafted into the NFL each year. In other words, the chances of a high school senior football player going pro is less than 1 in 1,000. Even if they defy the odds to get there, the average NFL careers lasts 3.3 years and 78% of players go broke within 3 years of retirement. It is worth considering that the mountain might not be worth climbing if only 1 in 1,000 get there and 4 in 5 fall right back to the bottom once they do. Tom Brady may be a winner, but the NFL is a loser's game. Almost all of the most popular games are.\n\nPeter competed from a young age, got into Stanford, then Stanford Law, then became a lawyer at a prestigious law firm before deciding to quit seven months in. He realized he had been competing in a loser's game. In the competition to become a partner at the firm, many more would lose than win. He had already come much further than most by getting into the firm in the first place, but remember, the average NFL career lasts 3.3 years. Peter realized he was competing in a loser's game. More importantly, he realized this was not at all the game that he wanted to play. It was simply the competition he got drawn into by the external pressures which fed his burning desire to compete. Since then, Peter has found his extraordinary success by actively searching for opportunities where there was no competition. He founded PayPal as the first successful online payments company. He went on to invest in monopolies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb and many others. By striving to avoid competition, he has ironically become one of the great founders and investors of our time.\n\nScott, the cartoonist, also does not believe in the merits of competition. He recommends instead becoming very good (like in the top 25%) at two or more things and putting them together. He said, \"In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I'm hardly an artist. And I'm not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I'm funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes.\" This is how Scott made himself a success with Dilbert.\n\nIt is unnaturally difficult not to play the game that everyone around you is playing. It is difficult too not to compete in the ways that society tells you is good. But competition is for losers. Restaurants don't make money. Steve Jobs said, \"Think different.\" Apple does."}]}

They were walking at their local park when they took note of a new, spider-webby-looking play thing at the jungle gym. It looked like fun. They wanted to go try it but worried what people might think of an adult on the playground. After some internal deliberation, they decided to do it anyway. It was a blast.\n\nThis morning, I was walking on the beach, near where the water meets the sand. I crossed a woman walking in the opposite direction. I was walking south and she was walking north so the sun was rising to my left and her right. I noticed from afar that she was wearing a hat that was pointed directly sideways, like a schoolboy in the 2000’s pretending to be a rapper. I hadn’t seen that style in a while, and never on a grown woman. At first, it struck me as odd. Then I realized it was blocking her face perfectly from the sun. It was not weird. It was smart. It was even cool because she didn’t care if it looked weird. I respected it. \n\nBoth of these stories share a similar thread. The person in them prioritizes what they want to do over how it may look to others. They are choosing to have a sensible ignorance of optics — the first one to have some fun, the second one to block the sun. \n\nIt would be extreme to suggest that optics don’t matter at all. The homeless person shooting up heroin on the sidewalk of a San Franciscan street is also doing what they want and ignoring the optics, but that can be really disturbing to the people around them. In addition to being generally unsmart, that’s just not sensible. \n\nThere are times when optics matter, when they should be prioritized over what you otherwise might want to do. You don’t show up to a wedding in sweatpants because you want to be comfortable. But sometimes it is best to have a sensible ignorance of optics. \n\nAfter the first person I mentioned was done having fun on the jungle gym, they looked back to see that the father of the only kids there was now playing on the spider web himself. Believe it or not, the very next person I crossed on the beach was a man with his hat pointed sideways just like the woman. I doubt it was a coincidence. Ignoring norms in a way that’s worthwhile can inspire others to do the same. That’s how we break the bad ones and make the new ones.\n\nSo, next time you want to do something but you’re worried about the optics, don’t disregard that worry as unfounded — it’s useful — but ask yourself if it would be sensible to ignore them in this case. It will probably just result in some small story like the two I’ve told above. But you might just start a revolution."}]}
