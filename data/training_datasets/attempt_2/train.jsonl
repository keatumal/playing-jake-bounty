If you have an opinion on Elon but have not taken the time to listen to him speak, I encourage you to either drop your opinion or take the time to listen to him speak. Far too many people these days develop opinions on people they do not know at all. These opinions are formed from headlines, tweets, and the opinions of other people who also do not know the person they have formed their opinions on. Podcasts, blogs, and books are better. Many understand Elon is extraordinarily smart. Having read his biography and listened to him speak for at least 5 hours worth of podcasts, I believe Elon is an extraordinarily good person too.\n\nIn his conversation with Joe, Elon discussed the concept of \"life years\". Joe mentioned he had read something that suggested the average person who died from COVID-19 would have lived another 10 years had they not died of COVID-19. Elon said this number sounded much too high. For now, let us take it for what it is, however, I imagine it is more likely to be accurate or high than it is to be low. Early reports from China said the average age of death was 75 and recent reports from Pennsylvania said it was 79. Both of these numbers are higher than the global average lifespan of 71 years. That does not look like a decade of life lost per person, but the data is not nearly as good as I would like it to be, so I will give the 10 year estimate the benefit of the doubt. Multiply that 10 years per person by the 289,000 COVID-19 deaths reported worldwide and you get a product of 2.89 million life years lost as a result of COVID-19 so far this year. This is an inconceivably terrible number to be sure, but less so than the numbers I am about to introduce as they relate to children-under-5 mortality.\n\nFor every COVID-19 death this year, approximately 10 children under 5 years old have died (2.76 million). Over-conservatively assuming a death age of 4 combined with the lowest national average life expectancy in the world (52 in Sierra Leone), that equals 48 years lost per life. Multiply that 48 years per person by the 2.76 million lives that have been lost of children under 5 this year and you get a product of 132.48 million. That means for every 1 life year lost to COVID-19 this year, 45 life years are lost to deaths of children under 5. It is worth reiterating how intentionally over-conservative my assumptions were. The real ratio could easily be greater than 100 to 1. If only we focused on preventing these deaths of children under 5 half as much as we have focused on preventing deaths from COVID-19. We could save a lot of lives, and many more healthy life years.\n\nAdditionally, children-under-5 mortality seems to be a much more quantifiable problem to solve. We can save lives for known costs as opposed to the unknown consequences of shutting down the entire economy. I know we know how to solve more than 90% of the problems some countries are facing with child mortality because other countries have already solved them. The mortality rate for under 5-year-olds in low-income countries is 14 times the rate of those same aged kids in high-income countries. Why is the world not focused on closing that gap? High-income countries clearly know how to effectively limit the number of under-5-year-old lives lost in a way that low-income countries must either not have the knowledge, money, or desire to do themselves. I doubt it is due to a lack of desire. Why do we as humanity let this persist, but when it comes to COVID-19, there is no price too great to save a single human life? If we lessened the death rate of children under 5 by just 10% this year, we would have saved as many lives as have been lost to COVID-19, and at least 4-5x as many life years, if not many more.\n\nThere are too many terrible issues for us to continue to pretend there is no price not worth paying to eliminate one single issue that has not so far been as bad as many others that we ignore despite the fact that they are much more clearly preventable and less costly to do. Why don't we save the kids?"}]}

Most of the rest of the time it is either johns@, smithj@, somehow involves a middle initial, or is generally unguessable or not worth the time to figure out unless the hunter.io results make clear the harder to guess syntax.\n\nStep 3 - For better than 90% of people, you should now have a best guess email address that will work better than 75% of the time.\n\nNote - if your first guess does not work, go back to hunter.io and see if there were any other common syntaxes, or else make educated guesses based on my note above. Mailtester.com can be used to test email addresses rather than sending and getting them bounced, however, it is only sometimes useful (all green means confirmed, any red means failed, and often it is green & yellow which doesn’t tell you one way or the other).\n\nPart 2 - Considerations for the cold email:\n\nAnyone who has recruited for an internship or job in investment banking or another networking necessary industry likely is already familiar with some version of the process above. It is not at all difficult or complex. What is difficult is getting people to respond, so what is complex is trying to figure out how best to do so. After sending hundreds of cold emails, being fortunate enough to get a job in banking, and then receiving hundreds more, I have come across one important realization and a few things I believe one can do to improve the rate of response on cold emails.\n\nMy important realization was that regardless of what you say in the subject or body of your electronic mail, the outcome of whether the person responds or not is entirely up to and dependent on that person, not you. You can write the perfect email, whatever that looks like, but if the person to whom you are sending it is home sick vomiting with a fever while simultaneously running behind on a project that is totally consuming their week, you simply are not going to get a response. This is important to remember so as not to waste too much time striving for perfection. I hear a lot of successful people saying done is better than perfect. That certainly applies here.\n\nThat said, the few things that I do believe you can do to give yourself the best rate of response in aggregate are as follows:\n\n1\\. Keep it brief. This person does not care about you, not even enough to care to read about why you are telling them they should care about you. They get these emails all the time and they all look mostly the same. It is bold to be brief. No one ever lost interest and stopped reading halfway through a tweet. Use that length as a parameter.\n\n2\\. Attach your resume. Since you are keeping the email brief, you will not have room to tell them much if anything about yourself. Attach your resume in case you are lucky enough to get their attention and interest in who you are. They might care enough to open it but not enough to ask for it, and they might respond if they like it but they won’t like it if they never see it. To avoid wasting a sentence telling the person my resume is attached, I often either put “ (resume attached) ” after my name at the end or don’t mention it all. They can see the attachment.\n\n3\\. Check the time. Jeffery Fox in his book How to Become a Rainmaker says the best time to sell is on Friday afternoon. This has stuck with me for years and in many regards I buy it. People are happy on Friday afternoons and they tend to be open and careless and kind. At the same time, some people also will stop checking their email for the weekend and may not want to give you the time of day on a precious Friday so I like to send emails Thursday afternoons as well. I stay away from most mornings when people generally like to get cracking on their to-do lists and are less tolerant of distractions. I especially stay away from Monday mornings, the most generally hated time of the week. Don’t worry too much about it because you never know. Just take a moment to put yourself in the person’s shoes and think about timing for a second.\n\n4\\. Be persistent. You will not annoy anyone by following up on your first email even if the person does not respond. No one cares. Emails from anyone can be annoying for everyone. The person is not going to hold a personal vendetta against you. You have nothing to lose and it is unlikely they will even remember your name. If you were emailing me, however, I have found that a second email from the same person makes me more inclined to respond. I respect persistence in almost any case and this has worked on my behalf as well. Ask for what you want, and then ask again.\n\nIn closing, these are the things that I think about when I send cold emails, and my cold emails tend to work well, better than most I can confidently say. I have made connections with billionaires, bankers, venture capitalists, CEOs, authors, and others through cold emails. Don’t be afraid to reach out to anyone. Email the CEO instead of an associate. When it comes to the cold email, as with so many other things, it pays to have guts. Good luck."}]}

We are excited to experience the Georgia woods.\n\nYesterday, I completed the Stanford Code in Place course that I wrote about previously. For my final project, I created an animation using Python.

I also said I believed that would morph over time. Little did I know that two weeks later every restaurant and theater in New York City would be closed for at least a month by the executive order of the mayor. Sufficed to say, today I will not be reviewing New York restaurants nor movies that I saw in the theaters this weekend, but I do have a few miscellaneous items to write about.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nNJ Toll Booth - my brother and I took an Uber home to New Jersey on Thursday evening and Friday I took the Jeep to Lauren's house in Pennsylvania to spend the weekend there with her and her family. I have always found it curious that while driving along Route 202 I have to pay a toll on the way to Pennsylvania but not on the way back to New Jersey. In my view, my home state's not great reputation to most outsiders is not helped by this small fact that you literally have to pay to leave but can enter free of charge. Sadly, I suppose this is what happens when I cannot write so much about food and movies. I write about toll booths.\n\nThe Salt House \\- in what I imagined would be our last dinner out for a while (voluntarily if not by governmental decree), Lauren and I ate at The Salt House in New Hope, PA for the second time in the last few months. I cannot speak to too much of the menu because we each have ordered the burger both times and will likely do the same next time, which I hope comes sooner than later. It is a nice and juicy burger with cheese and caramelized onions on top served with crispy french fries and garlic aioli on the side which I skip and ask for ketchup to replace. They make a good mezcal negroni as well. We got lucky to sit at the same table as last time which seems like it could have been built for a world of social distancing. The table is in a room small enough to fit only it, with windowed walls to the outside on three sides and the last side open to the main room of the small restaurant which probably only seats around 16 or 20 people downstairs with another handful of high chairs at the bar. There is pink, black, and white salt on every table, all of which we use on our fries.\n\nFerriss/Kornfield \\- by the time I got to going for a run last Friday afternoon, I was fairly spent and frankly pretty frustrated from the week that had passed. Anyone who has felt a high sense of responsibility to take the coronavirus situation seriously and to urge others to do the same will understand what I am talking about. Some people just need to see it before they can believe it. Fortunately, many more Americans are taking it seriously after the unprecedented reactions of governments and organizations this past week, but more still will take it seriously a week from now and then a week from then as the reality of the virus itself begins to show in the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths which we have unfortunately yet to scratch the surface of, and as the stock market continues to tumble. As the situation gets worse before it gets better, it will be important for people to start now (if they have not already) searching for ways that work for them to relieve fear, anxiety, and depression. This podcast called How to Find Peace Amidst COVID-19, How to Cultivate Calm in Chaos acts almost as a therapy session with Tim Ferriss as the patient and Jack Kornfield as the therapist. It was helpful for me to hear on Friday if for no other reason because of the calming tone of the conversation. There are a couple of perspectives shared and practices described that may be helpful for you too. There is a fine balance between doing everything we reasonably can to prevent the foreseeable damage we see happening in all of this and falling back on principles like that there is no such thing as good or bad, and that the worst times get better. This podcast helps shift the weight from the former to the latter frame of mind. In their conversation, Jack tells of a spiritual teacher who once pointed to a massive boulder in a field and asked him and his fellow students if the rock seemed to heavy to them. When they replied \"yes\", the teacher responded, \"not if you do not pick it up\". This is how I feel about the weight of the world right now and the feeling of responsibility I have to warn others about what I think is coming, but that is a heavy boulder to be holding all of the time. Jack's story helped me realize I needed to put it down for a bit. Fortunately, I was able to do so for most of the rest of the weekend, relaxed a bit, and had a good time.\n\nHow to Get Rich \\- by Sunday afternoon, I had nearly tricked my mind into feeling life was normal again, despite a stop at a more than usually empty grocery store on my way home by the toll-less road from Pennsylvania. With a clear mind, I embarked upon a run under a blue sky and strong sun. It was the first time I had gone for a run in just shorts and a t-shirt since last fall in Seoul with my buddy Eric and our host and friend Yuncheol. Eric returned to the US after 8 months of unadulterated travel this weekend and I hope we can run together again soon. During my run on Sunday I listened to this How to Get Rich podcast by Naval, who founded AngelList (the leading platform connecting startup founders to investors) and is widely recognized as one of the wisest people in Silicon Valley. This podcast is incredibly dense with logical insights on how to become wealthy in terms of gaining the freedom to do as one wishes. Counter to what the name of the episode might suggest, it is practically the opposite of any sort of scam-like get rich quick type program. I am only a bit over an hour into the episode, but it has resonated thus far as powerful and true, and I look forward to continuing it and maybe even listening again.\n\nCatch Phrase \\- this is a game where a word or phrase comes up on the Catch Phrase device and the person holding the device has to get the others to guess it without saying any part of the word or phrase itself. A bunch of us played it this weekend at Lauren's and made a drinking game out of it with a simple rule that you have to drink every time you get stuck with the device when the timer runs out. You can get the device for less than $20 on Amazon and it may serve as a nice in-home game for you and whoever you are locked down with as the social distancing continues. I realize it is somewhat ironic to recommend a game that involves passing a device which requires everyone to hit the same button when it is their turn in a time when everyone is supposed to keep their hands to themselves. That said, if you and a few people are locked down in the same place, the chances are you are all taking the same precautions in terms of interactions with the outside world and there are probably more things than this game that everyone in the house is touching and sharing so I do not feel this is a particularly irresponsible recommendation, especially if everyone washes their hands before and after and tries not to touch their faces. That does not mean one should go and invite friends from far and wide to come play it, but for the purpose of finding some entertainment with your house arrested crew, this game should do. A free version of a similar game that my family and our family friends who showed us have played is called The Name Game. In this game, everyone write up a dozen or more names on small strips of paper to be folded and mixed together in a bowl to be drawn upon by whoever's turn it is. Combined with a phone timer, you no longer need the Catch Phrase device for words/phrases or time and it can end up being even more fun to see the random names that people come up with.\n\nKnives Out \\- an 8.0 is a strong rating on IMDb, so even though this move never struck me as looking very good on the commercials, I gave it a shot with my family last night. I would not put it in the same league as the other Oscar's contenders for Best Picture that I saw this year, but it was a good and entertaining movie with an ending worth watching through. I am not the person who usually guesses what is going to happen in a movie before it happens, but even those who are that type of person I would think would have a hard time with this one. Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas do a great job and I would recommend the movie, just not as highly as IMDb.\n\nIn closing, at the risk of repetition, I urge everyone to take social distancing seriously, and practice it as much as you reasonably can. Sure I went to dinner on Friday at a low capacity restaurant in rural Pennsylvania, but I also made the executive decision at the eleventh hour last Wednesday for my group of six not to go use our tickets to the Big East Tournament at MSG which sat thousands in NYC for what ended up being one of the last sporting events in America before the wave of cancellations came in. I saw a funny message going around the other day which said something like this, \"Our grandparents were forced to fight in wars for us. All we are being asked to do is stay at home. We can do it.\" In other words, we are being asked to do something that previous generations would have begged to do -- stay home and be safe. More than that, those generations did not have Netflix, let alone the internet, let alone color TV or any TV at all just a century ago. With that in mind, I hope you stay home, stay healthy, and stay safe, and when the rock gets heavy, put it down for a bit."}]}

Before that, the longest I had ever meditated in one sitting was 20 minutes. The vast majority of the time, I do it for 10.\n\nThat always seemed to me to be the standard amount of time for a meditation, at least according to all of the major apps I have tried including Waking Up, Headspace, and Calm.\n\nI have not experienced first-hand very many noticeable benefits from meditation, but I have heard enough about them from people I trust and admire to revisit the practice time and time again over the last few years. Still, it has yet to really stick.\n\nWhen I think of meditation, I don't think of the guiding voices in the apps. I think of sitting still with eyes closed, paying attention to the thoughts of my mind and the sensations of my senses. In other words, I try to become the \"witness\", as it is called in The Untethered Soul , a book by Michael Singer which is the best and one of the only ones I have read as a recommendation from my mother (she reads a lot more than I do).\n\nToday, as I sat cross-legged with my eyes closed for an hour on the dock by the pond, I had a hard time with the practice. To be clear, for anyone who has not ever tried it, sitting still with your eyes closed for any period of time is hard. As usual, I noticed little benefit other than a quickly fleeting feeling of bliss in the brief moments after the harp of my timer sounded and I slowly opened my eyes. Admittedly, that part is nice, but again, it is quickly fleeting. My right foot went numb at a point that must have been less than halfway into the hour and so I was constantly tweaking my position to try to get the feeling back in the foot. That reminded me of a form of hazing which my fraternity brothers and I went through during pledging. So there I was trying to meditate, thinking about how I basically hazing myself. As far as my other thoughts were concerned, my mind wandered all over the place over the course of 60 minutes. While it did seem to slow down a bit, it continuously came back to wondering how much time was left on my phone timer sitting beside me on the dock.\n\nIf I had to judge this meditation, I might give it a five out of ten, but I suppose the point is not to judge it but to simply follow the advice of one of my favorite slogans of any company, \"just do it.\"\n\nAs with most things, I believe the practice must get better with practice. That is what I have heard at least. If there is any time to practice the practice, this seems as good a time as any to do so. I hope to write again one day soon with some newfound success in the ancient tradition of meditation. Until then, I figured it might be helpful to share something I have tried that has not necessarily worked, if for no other reason, to make it more believable when I write about the things that have."}]}

In 1859, a man by the name of Thomas Austin is purported to have released 24 of them to the wild for hunting purposes, and it is believed that his small release originated the infestation that exists today.\n\nOver the last 150 years or so, rabbits have absolutely dominated the Australian ecosystem, leading to the extinction of many native species and wreaking havoc on the land and the human population’s ability to farm it. In America, bunnies are cute. In Australia, they are pests.\n\nIn an attempt to take their land back from the bunnies, Australians have released deadly diseases to the rabbit population, once killing over 90%. They have introduced predators of the rabbit, built fences to contain them and hunted aggressively, but to no avail. The rabbits took over too quickly and reproduced to a level of prevalence too powerful to reverse. The rabbits have persisted and arguably grown stronger now than ever, not in numbers, but in the strength of their resistance.\n\nThe rabbits’ conquer of Australia shows how critical the conditions of an environment are to enabling something new to dominate. Rabbits never came close to dominating Europe, but they almost instantaneously took over Australia due to the near perfect conditions that the environment offered. Once the rabbit dominated the continent, it became very difficult for any similar species, even if it was better in some ways, to be introduced to compete with the rabbit, let alone thrive. The rabbits reproduced exponentially faster than any new species due to their already massive population and they had generational experience on the land as well as a long history of resisting the greatest of attacks on their kind.\n\nIn the 21st century, rabbits are built by software. They are technology companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, and AirBnB. Even Bitcoin is a rabbit. These were not necessarily the first movers in their respective categories, but rather, the first to be introduced to the right environment where they could thrive and grow quickly to dominate. Once the bread grows mold, it quickly spreads. The goliaths of tech have become more powerful largely as a result of their network effects, but the critical mass was achieved by introducing a good product in the right environment at the right time.\n\nIt will not be easy to kill the rabbits."}]}

While they are rising, they can tell you how they are thinking, what they are doing, and why. Once they have risen, they can only reflect on what they think got them there, and what they think got them there is often very different from what actually did.\n\nHere are a couple examples of things you can read from extraordinary entrepreneurs still relatively early in their respective rises:\n\n1\\. Steve Job's biography from 1988. This was written during an interesting time. It was after Jobs was ousted from Apple (1985) but before he came back (1997). Steve was already an extraordinary success from his first run with Apple, but his second run produced the iMac, iPod, Macbook, iPad, and of course, the iPhone. What an incredible time this was to learn from perhaps the greatest entrepreneur of all-time.\n\n2\\. Sam Altman's blog posts from 10+ years ago. Back then, Sam had sold his first company for $40M and he had become a partner at YC, but he was not nearly the success that he is today. He started the blog before he became President of YC, well before he co-founded and eventually became CEO of OpenAI. At that time, he was just an extremely fast-rising 20-something. His blogs provide a window into how he got to where he is.\n\nThe only issue with these examples is that they are dated. There are many timeless lessons of course, but all of what worked for Steve in the 2000's or Sam in the 2010's is unlikely to work exactly the same for you today. So the challenge is to find people who are rising NOW. There is a massive reward for finding someone you believe will be the next Steve or Sam or otherwise extraordinarily successful person and learning from them now, while they are rising, however you can. \n\nThis is the beauty of podcasts and blogs. Books are often dated by the time they are published, but podcasts and blogs are pretty much published in real-time, plus they are public and free. If the person you believe in does not write publicly or speak on podcasts, find a way to learn from them privately. Volunteer to work for them. Do whatever you need to do. \n\nIf you find someone you believe will rise to extraordinary heights, and you believe they are still in the early or middle stages of that rise, they should be an excellent person for you to learn from.

I was not thinking at that time that most of the world would be working remotely by Easter. Now that most are, many of the biggest struggles that remote workers identify have become apparent to a lot of people all at once. The four struggles most commonly identified as the single biggest are unplugging after work (21%), loneliness (19%), collaboration and/or communication (17%), and distractions at home (10%). I personally would select unplugging after work as my own biggest struggle with working from home. Even though I do not have a full-time job working for an employer, I am frequently working, and I sometimes have a difficult time turning off my driving desire to be productive. That desire, like all others, results in struggle as long as it is kept on but unsatisfied. For whatever reason, I had a particularly difficult time unplugging this weekend. I spent some time trapped in a state of wanting to do something worthwhile but instead doing a lot of the worst kinds of nothing, like distracting myself with my phone, boredom snacking, and thinking about what to do. For me, the best way past this described state is to take some pressure off of myself, to give myself permission to waste time, and more than anything, to simply wait it out. I am very fortunate that I have many more good times than bad ones and many more good days than bad ones but no one is immune to the latter of either, and without the bad, there would be no good anyway. Realistically, I had a fine time this weekend and a pretty great day Saturday, but hours of the day on Sunday were spent in the way that I describe, frustrated by a feeling of inability to unplug the wire in my brain which drives my sometimes relentless desire to always be doing things that are worthwhile. I will likely write more about struggling by desire and wasting time trying not to waste time another time. Maybe soon.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\n1979 Movies \\- I watched two movies from the year 1979 over the weekend. The first was The Black Stallion and the second was Manhattan. The first was produced by Francis Ford Coppola and the second was written and directed by Woody Allen. The first got a 7.3 on IMDb and the second got a 7.9. Both received full 4 star ratings from Roger Ebert's reviews. The first had no actors I knew and the second had Woody Allen, Meryl Streep, and Diane Keaton. The first made me long for the beach in summer times and the second made me long for New York in normal times. The first had very little talking and the second had very much. Both were good movies in my book, but I preferred the first.\n\nMaples/Rabois \\- during my Saturday morning run, I listened for the first time to Mike Maples, Jr.'s Starting Greatness podcast. I listened to the hour-long episode with Keith Rabois, former Paypal, LinkedIn, and Square executive who is now a general partner at Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. Keith is a well-known contrarian in the valley and I tend to gravitate towards people who by definition tend to see things differently than most. This was the first time I had heard him speak and I enjoyed the episode as expected. In particular, I liked hearing Keith's perspective on the different styles he witnessed from Peter Thiel at PayPal versus Jack Dorsey at Square. Considering that both companies aimed to innovate on the ways in which people make payments, and considering that both have been generally successful, one might reasonably assume that their leaders took similar or at least overlapping approaches to running their businesses, but Keith reveals that, in fact, this was not the case. Peter created a culture focused on math and speed and believed that his job was to make 3 or 4 really big decisions per year based around hiring, firing, or critical strategies. Jack created a culture focused on design and customer experience, going so far as to ban A/B testing, in which customers would be served two varying experiences to determine which worked better, because he did not want any customer to be served a worse experience than his company was capable of providing. Unlike Peter, Jack spent a lot of time in the weeds and concerned himself with much smaller decisions than Peter did. Clearly, both styles seem to have worked very well for their respective companies which were as similar as their leaders were different. In today's environment where many people are in agreement on the single best ways to go about doing certain things, it was refreshing to hear a perspective which supports the idea that there is \"more than one way to skin a cat\", or in more modernly literal terms, \"more than one way to scale a payments company.\"\n\nHome Haircuts \\- a couple of weeks ago, my brother gave me a simple buzzcut with a 3 setting. My father helped by using a leafblower to air the hair off of my face, which was surprisingly as enjoyable as it was effective. This weekend, I turned the buzzer back on my brother as he had been pursuing the ill-advised strategy of giving a haircut to himself but asked for my help on evening out the sides and blending them into the top. I learned that the blend of a fade is all about the wrist. The curling of the clippers away from the head as the buzzer moves up allows for a progressively shorter to longer cut, and therein lies the blend. I am not proclaiming to have a future as a barber, but if nothing else, I will come out of this quarantine more confident in my ability to give a decent haircut.\n\nNaval/Balaji \\- for my Sunday run, I listened to an episode of the Venture Stories podcast with two guys who are well known enough with unusual enough names to be known by their first names only, Naval and Balaji. They are two of my few favorite follows on Twitter. The podcast episode was from November 2018 and focused on the future of crypto, so if you are interested in crypto, it is probably worth a listen, but if you are not, it is probably not. Part of my greatest conviction in Bitcoin and crypto more generally is founded on the fact that many of the people whose beliefs and predictions I have come to trust the most believe and predict that Bitcoin and crypto more generally is going to be a tremendously valuable part of the future. The fact that both Naval and Balaji are focusing much of their time and energy on this technology is a great example of that.\n\nAndrea Bocelli \\- my mother and I watched the famed Italian opera singer's Music For Hope performance on Easter Day. It was performed from an empty Duomo in Milan and to watch it was a somewhat awesome experience. His rendition of Amazing Grace from atop the doorsteps outside of the church was my favorite part and it concluded his performance like the grand finale of a fireworks show on the 4th. I imagine this final song of his performance __ might be looked back upon for a long time to come as one of the most poignant and yet hopeful symbols of this time. I will close this post with a link to it for those who might like to go watch it for the first time, or like I just did, for a second.\n\n[URL]"}]}

Unlike last weekend, for whatever reason, our local Bedminster Pizza was not doing delivery. We called in the order and paid by card over the phone before driving over, parking with a couple of spots in between ours and the car next to us, and opening the door to the backseat. I called inside and had them bring the boxes out, put them on the backseat, and close the door before we drove away. It was a clean transaction in the literal sense, and my first time leaving the house other than on foot in more than a couple of weeks. In these distanced times, the eventful picking up of a pizza was my Saturday night adventure.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nBill Withers \\- Often we come to appreciate people most only after they are gone. This is an unfortunate aspect of the human condition. \"Memento mori\" is a wise saying that I have come to appreciate. The Latin phrase translates to say, “Remember you must die”. It helps me make the most of life. Additionally, remembering that everyone will die helps me to appreciate the people in my life. Eerily, in the last music video before his tragically young death, Mac Miller etched out the words “memento mori” inside the top of a coffin that he was stuck in while smoking a cigarette. I have written about how big a fan I have always been of his music, but never did I appreciate it more until after he was gone. When Kobe died earlier this year, I began to appreciate him too more than ever as I joined the world in remembering the highlights of his life and watching the highlights of his games. This weekend, Bill Withers passed away, and it was not premature like Mac or Kobe, and, honestly, I could not have even told you with any confidence whether he was dead or alive before I heard this news that he passed, but his passing has caused me to go back and listen to more of his music nonetheless. He has more than a handful of popular songs including Lovely Day, Just The Two of Us, Use Me, Leon on Me, Ain’t No Sunshine, and Grandma’s Hands which I would say I like best in that order. Lesser known songs that I have played over and over again in the past include Can We Pretend and Sweet Wanoni, but I recognize that I have a whole lot more digging to do. When it comes to appreciation, I believe strongly in the concept of better late than never. I hope to create things throughout my life that allow people to appreciate me more than ever after I am gone too.\n\nThe Way Back – Ben Affleck plays a construction worker in what seems like it could be the 30 years older continuation of his character from Good Will Hunting , and that actually would not be far from consistent timing given the 23 years that have passed since the release of what is one of my top few favorite movies of all time. In The Way Back , Ben’s character turns out to have been a high school basketball superstar and when something happens to his former high school’s basketball coach, the religious school’s priest asks the drunk you later learn to sympathize with to return for the first time since he left to try and bring the team to the playoffs for the first time since he left as well. There may not be a better movie genre for me than the underdog coach with an underdog team, so naturally, I liked this movie a lot. Was it on par with Remember the Titans, The Hoosiers, or Coach Carter? No, no, and probably not. Still, I enjoyed it a lot, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes that kind of movie.\n\nUnscrypted – My latest podcast obsession is helping me continue to scratch the surface of all there is to know about Bitcoin and the world of crypto. The podcast is a collection of audio recordings of unscripted talks given by Andreas Antonopolous, the best teacher of this subject that I have found, whose Introduction to Bitcoin speech I have recommended in the past. If you like learning through podcast listening and you are interested in Bitcoin, this could be a great podcast for you, and if you are not interested in Bitcoin but you would be interested in what could be the most revolutionary shift in the concept of money that anyone alive will have ever seen, then I would humbly assert that you should be.\n\nCOVID-19K Run – Last Friday, I wrote about a fundraiser that I organized in which people are walking or running 19 kilometers at their own pace and on their own time over hours, days, or weeks to help feed those in need facing hunger in America. All of the great work for the cause is done by an organization called Feeding America. I felt somewhat silly having started a fundraiser with a $19,000 goal when the day after starting it I saw that Leonardo DiCaprio and Laurene Powell Jobs had since started a fundraiser with half of the proceeds also going to Feeding America and a much larger goal of $15,000,000. Still, I feel good about having created this means by which my limited network can contribute to this organization and I believe the objective of feeding hungry people who cannot afford to pay for basic needs will prove to be an essential in the coming months. I suppose Leo & Laurene can fall back on that same logic now that Jeff Bezos has also since stepped in and donated $100,000,000 in one fell swoop. While these massive fundraises make mine represent nothing more than a rounding error, I am following through with what I set out to do. We continue to raise awareness and donations because no matter how small it all may seem in the scheme of things, I am very confident it will go on to have a positive impact of some magnitude. On Sunday afternoon, I ran my 19K like I said I would. It was the second longest run of my life and my 10 minute 20 second per mile pace was better than I expected I would do, so overall I felt very good afterwards, even though my body felt pretty bad. Like doing anything else in life, I found it was helpful to know the reason why I was running and to believe in that reason strongly. It was still hard as I am in much better shape mentally than I am physically, but it did make it easier all in all. If you did not see my previous post, you can find more information on the COVID-19K Feeding America fundraiser at www.gofundme.com/covid-19k .\n\nIt is a beautiful day today where I am home quarantined. I hope that is a sign for the week to come. We will make it through this wild time, one day at a time."}]}

I realized that last night when I was playing Backgammon with Lauren. I had a roll of the dice that gave me no choice but to leave one of my pieces exposed. The only choice I had was where to leave it. I could either leave it 8 spots away from the closest threatening piece of hers, or 4. That’s when I thought of the numbers on the Catan board.\n\nCatan board\n\nThe numbers on the Catan board are presented as larger or smaller (font size) with a higher or lower number of dots underneath them (between 1 and 5) representing the frequency with which they are expected to be rolled (as the total of two dice). As you can see in the image above, the 6 and the 8 are presented as the largest numbers, each with 5 dots underneath them. That means they are the most common totals to be rolled. To highlight that fact, the 6 and the 8 are further distinguished from all of the other numbers from 2 to 12 in that they are presented in a red font instead of a black font (more on fonts later).\n\nThanks for reading BLOG OF JAKE! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nI remembered the red 8 when I had my choice to make in Backgammon, and I remembered the small 4. I didn’t remember how many dots the 4 had, but I knew it was not red, and I knew it was smaller than the 8. So I knew that the odds that Lauren would roll a 4 on her next turn were lower than the odds that she would roll an 8. I left the exposed piece 4 spots away. She rolled. I was safe. I went on to win the game.\n\nNow you might say that I could have made the same move even if I had no familiarity with Catan. You could argue that I should have thought of the probabilities anyway, and that I should have been able to figure out that an 8 is a more likely roll than a 4. You could rightly recite that there are 5 different combinations that can make an 8 (2+6 or 3+5 or 4+4 or 5+3 or 6+2) but only 3 that can make a 4 (1+3 or 2+2 or 3+1). But that takes some time to think about. Moreover, I might not have thought about it at all if my brain hadn’t suddenly gone to Catan.\n\nCatan didn’t just give me a shortcut to figure out which spot had a better probability of being safe. It prompted me to think about that probability in the first place. And yes, you could further argue that I should have been thinking about that regardless. But there is a huge difference between what we should do or could have done and what we actually do or would have done. And in a casual Sunday night game of Backgammon, when I’m just relaxing and not thinking too much about anything, frankly, I’m just not sure I would have thought of it.\n\nThanks to my limited experience playing Catan, I did think of it. And thanks to that, I thought to write this. It struck me as a simple example of how understanding different disciplines (in this case, different games) can be useful in unexpected ways. It never occurred to me that learning how to play Catan would make me a better Backgammon player, and yet it did. ~~You could even argue it made me a slightly better writer, because it led me to write this, and most people agree the more you write the better you get. My learning how to play Catan even changed your life a little bit because if you’re reading this then you’re reading this and you would have otherwise been doing something else. Nonetheless, I digress.~~\n\nThe takeaway is that understanding different disciplines can be useful in unexpected ways. More generally, exposing yourself to different experiences can be useful in unexpected ways.\n\nI’ll end with this Steve Jobs quote from his famous 2005 Stanford Commencement Address.\n\n> “I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to [do calligraphy]. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful. Historical. Artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture. And I found it fascinating. None of this had any hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.\n> \n> It was the first computer with beautiful typography.\n> \n> If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would never have multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them.\n> \n> If I had never dropped out [of college], I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.\n> \n> Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.”\n> \n> Steve Jobs (2005 Stanford Commencement Address)\n\nOh, and as Steve liked to say, “one more thing” —\n\nThis winter, I’ll be coaching a high school basketball team (JV). I’ve never coached a sports team before, and I haven’t played organized ball since I was 17. It might seem random, off-track, and hard to justify. But I was interested. And my gut said go for it. Maybe that’s enough.\n\nSubscribe"}]}

Most of the time, it is not. Sometimes, it is.\n\nYesterday I had the once in a lifetime opportunity to run a marathon (26.2 miles) on my 26th birthday. I seized it.\n\nIt was slow and it was hard but I never stopped running. I was in worse shape than a month ago and my back had been acting up but I decided during my last week in Georgia that I would try it, so I did. Sometimes it is good to do something precisely because circumstances are imperfect and because it will be hard. If you can do that thing without all the proper conditions in place, it shows you how much you can do when things are wrong and expands your perspective on your potential with all things right. I was not 100% sure I had it in me yesterday but once I started running I knew I was not going to stop before the marathon was finished unless my body gave me an obvious sign that I had to. Fortunately, that sign never came.\n\nRunning 26 on my 26th was my birthday gift to myself. My mother summed it up perfectly in a text, “something no one else can give you.” I believe many of the greatest gifts in life are of this nature.\n\nI am thankful for Lauren’s help meeting me at a few checkpoints to refill my water bottle. I could not have done it without her. I am also thankful for my mother’s help bringing me food and water and some towels to lay on once I got home. I would not be here at all without her. Lastly, I am thankful to Jack for inspiring me to run, Eric for inspiring me to run far, and David Goggins for showing me the greatness of human potential.\n\nThe side benefit of running a marathon on my birthday was that for the rest of the day I could totally relax and people would make food and get water for me. I watched movies, played Scrabble, and ate cake. It was comically different than my 25th birthday in New York which included dinners at Del Posto and L’Artusi, brunch on a boat, and bottle service at Catch, but I would not have preferred either any other way. I expect to remember these birthdays as two of my best for the rest of my life.\n\nThis is going to be a great year."}]}

Some believe Bitcoin (\"BTC\") will solve wealth inequality. I am not so sure about that. But wealth inequality was not the subject of this analysis. My intention was only to see what I could learn from an analysis of the Top 100 Bitcoin addresses as they are provided at bitinfocharts.com.\n\nMy first observation was that the richest Bitcoin address was less rich than I expected. It is worth just under $2.5 billion and it is the only billionaire Bitcoin address. I suspect there are a few and maybe several more Bitcoin billionaires in the form of individuals who hold multiple addresses with balances that combine to over a billion dollars, but that is mostly speculation based on connecting addresses with first or last \"in\" or \"out\" dates that are the same. I will explain what those terms mean in the next paragraph.\n\nMy first really interesting observation was that 60 of the top 100 addresses had never once made an \"out\" (Figure 1). As the words suggest, an \"out\" is an occurence of BTC moving out of the address and an \"in\" is an occurence of BTC moving in. This can be thought of similarly to a \"buy\" and a \"sell\", respectively, with the nuance that an \"in\" can come from mining (basically, earning) the Bitcoin or simply transferring it in to one address from another address (the latter would show an \"out\"). Those addresses could be owned by the same person or entity and so an \"in\" is not necessarily synonymous with a \"buy\", but I do not think there is much harm in thinking of it as about the same. So isn't it interesting that 60 of the Top 100 addresses have zero \"outs\"? These addresses have bought, earned, or transferred in BTC, usually on many occasions, but they have never once sold or made an \"out\". This seems to support the thesis that Bitcoin believers are in it for the long haul. At the very least, it seems the majority of the richest ones have held absolutely and without exception thus far. But if Bitcoin is going to have a lasting impact, these are still early days for the decade-old technology that some call \"digital gold\".\n\nFigure 1\n\nIt is even earlier days for many of Bitcoin's largest owners. This was my second interesting observation. It turns out that most of the addresses in the Top 100 made their first \"in\" sometime after the beginning of the year 2018 (Figure 2). This is where it is important to recognize the difference between an \"in\" and a \"buy\". It is possible that many of these addresses with first \"ins\" in 2018 or later received funds transferred in by individuals or entities that have held those funds in other addresses for much longer. I have no reason to believe this to be true. I am simply acknowledging it as a possibility.\n\nSetting that caveat aside, one can assume that \"big money\" or what is commonly called institutional interest in Bitcoin has been greater than ever since 2018, and great enough to gain enough Bitcoin to displace older holders in the Top 100. The lowest price and best buying opportunity since 2018 was around $3,400. Bitcoin has spent the majority of the time since 2018 at a price between $6,000 and $10,000. At the current price around $9,300, it stands to reason that most of the Top 100 Bitcoin addresses \"first in\" since 2018, which is most of them, have not appreciated in value by more than 50%. To be up more than 50%, an address' average \"in\" would have to be lower than $6,200 per Bitcoin.\n\nQualitatively, it does not seem as though these are addresses of individuals who have become rich off Bitcoin and are now holding because they are playing with house money. It seems that most of these addresses are probably closer to being flat or down money than they are to being up double or more on their initial investments. By that logic, these addresses are not \"in\" because of what Bitcoin has done. They are \"in\" because of what they believe Bitcoin is going to do. Thus far, they are looking exceptionally patient.\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe tendency of Top 100 addresses to have been \"first in\" in 2018 or later is made even more interesting by looking at their \"last in\". Without exception, every address in the Top 100 has had at least one \"in\" in 2020 (Figure 3). Regardless of anything that makes them different, the Top 100 seem to have this one thing in common. They are all getting \"in\". I was curious to see how far this fact extended so I looked further at the Top 1,000. By my count, there are only 7 addresses out of the Top 1,000 that have not gone \"in\" within the last year, and all 7 of them bought between March 2019 and a year ago. This was surprising for me to see.\n\nThe Top 1,000 owns nearly 6.5 million BTC. That is more than one third (34.8%) of all the BTC in the world. It has been estimated that approximately 4 million BTC out of the 18.3 million existing (and 21 million that will ever exist) are out of circulation and gone forever. If that is true, then these Top 1,000 addresses own nearly half (44.5%) of all BTC and not a single one of them has failed to add to their balance at least once in the last 16 months. This would be unbelievable to me if I did not come to the conclusion myself based on the available data.\n\nBitcoin is not a company but it has a $173 billion market cap (total value) and so its largest addresses can be compared in some sense to the largest shareholders of a multi-billion dollar market cap company. The largest shareholders of multi-billion dollar companies, let alone $100 billion companies, are usually taking some of their chips off of the table at that stage, not unanimously loading up. I should make it clear that I recognize that the fact that all of these addresses have made an \"in\" recently does not necessarily mean they are increasing their balances, but an \"in\" is an \"in\" and if they were overall intent on cashing \"out\" I would expect them to make only \"outs\", not \"ins\".\n\nIn summary, it seems that most of the biggest Bitcoin owners bought recently, are holding strongly, and are buying more, frequently.\n\nThis analysis of the Top 100 Bitcoin addresses adds to my conviction that it is the best investment I have made in my lifetime, but it is only a small factor. I hope to write more about Bitcoin in the future. Until then, I will appreciate any feedback, comments, or questions sent to jake@blogofjake.com, especially by those who know something that I do not or see a flaw in my analysis."}]}

I like thinking about the future. And if, in thinking about the future, you can make a prediction which ends up coming to fruition, you can be successful in real estate investing just as you can be successful in angel investing or trading tech stocks. Instead of being bullish on a certain market in technology, like crypto or biotech, you might be bullish on a certain market in real estate, like Miami or Charleston. The analogy doesn’t stop there, but I will stop it there for now.\n\nI was thinking about the future this morning, through a real estate lens. A roundabout train of thought brought me to a possible thesis for real estate investing which I think is both interesting and differentiated – at least, I haven’t heard of it before.\n\nThe basic idea is that it could be smart to invest in real estate in states which one can anticipate will reduce their state tax rates in the next decade or so, ideally eliminating their state taxes altogether. If you consider this factor with ignorance of all other factors, the most bullish state would seem to be Mississippi. Yes, Mississippi.\n\nMississippi has been on a path of lowering state income taxes for some time, most recently increasing the amount of income one can make without paying any state tax, and lowering the flat tax on all income above that from 5% to 4% (source). Moreover, the governor has promised to push for elimination of the state’s income tax entirely (source). If Mississippi dropped their income tax from 4% to 0%, one would have to imagine that it would become some amount more attractive to some number of people already living in the south or elsewhere, where some percentage of those people would decide to move there as a result. With a demand increase and relatively stagnant supply, one would expect the prices to go up. Not to mention, anyone living in or looking to live in the state would have more money to spend for what they would figure to save as a result of no longer having to pay a 4-5% state income tax.\n\nMississippi is not the only state that one could reasonably bet on with this thesis in mind. Another state which might be more palatable to people moving from the East Coast could be North Carolina. North Carolina has been dropping its state income tax on individuals (as well as on corporations) repetitively for the last decade and plans to continue to do so for the next 5 years (source). One could speculate that North Carolina could further accelerate their plan in the same direction, or at least continue in that direction beyond the current 5-year plan, potentially on a path towards eliminating the state income tax entirely, a la Mississippi. \n\nI’m sure there are other states which might become interesting once you consider them with this thesis in mind, and I am by no means an expert on North Carolina, or Mississippi, nor state taxes, real estate, or really anything written about or contemplated in this piece – I’m just introducing an idea, and I would be thrilled for anyone to run with it however they may.\n\nFurther supporting this thesis in my mind is the more general thesis that the impacts of the sudden and significant shift to remote work that resulted from the pandemic have yet to materially play out, and rather, that they have barely even begun. As general as this thesis is, it is one in which I have high conviction. I strongly believe that big changes to the way we live and work are basically baked in for our future, but what exactly those changes will be is still very much up for debate, and depends on human actions, perhaps by people like you and me. That said, one clear change which has already begun to play out in a big way and which may be most predictable to continue has been the migration away from top tier states and cities into states and cities with better weather, more moderate governance, and perhaps more than anything, lower state taxes. This migration pattern was apparent in the first year of the pandemic and has persisted through 2023. I cannot think of many reasons I would expect it to stop or reverse, but I was able to think of one – and that’s what led to this specific thesis. \n\nI wondered what would happen if states like California and New York started lowering their state income taxes, and conversely what would happen if states like Florida and Texas starting increasing them. I don’t think any of this seems likely in the short term, and states like California and New York could very well do the opposite and raise their state income taxes to increase their parasitic efficiency on those residents who do remain, to make up for the losses of those who left. Regardless of whether these specific changes are realistic or not, in such a hypothetical situation, one could imagine that the migration trends as they stand today could slow and perhaps even reverse. From this standpoint, one can start to appreciate how zero state income tax states like Florida and Texas have no upside (in terms of this individual dimension only), and infinite downside, where states like California and New York have the most upside, given they have the most room to lower their state income taxes. \n\nThe practical thing to think about however is not which states have the most upside on this dimension, but rather, which states have the highest probability of realizing the largest amount of their upside in this dimension, and of doing so in the relatively near-term future. That’s where I speculate that states like Mississippi and North Carolina come into play.\n\nBroadly speaking, if you think of states as companies and their weather, schools, hospitals, and the like as the various features of their overall product, taxes are like the price, and price matters. The quality of the product determines the price that a company can charge, or the tax that a state can charge, but so does the quality of the competition. The reason that states like California and New York have been able to charge the prices (have the high state incomes taxes) that they have is because they have been objectively great states to live in -- great products. The weather in California is second to none in the country. Silicon Valley has been the tech capital of the world and Hollywood the same for entertainment. If you wanted to work in either industry, the benefits of living and working in the appropriate capital was thought to be well worth the price of admission (high cost of living, including but not limited to taxes). New York has New York City -- the same logic applies. Both states offered high quality products both in absolute terms and relative to other states, their primary competition, and so they were able to charge relatively high prices, and the people who could pay them would.\n\nThe pandemic leveled the playing field in terms of state-to-state competition in a way that is hard to overstate. Almost overnight, you could work on “Wall Street” while living on Main Street or work in “Silicon Valley” while living in Appalachian Valley, all thanks to remote work. In short, the availability of job opportunities which previously was far superior in some states and cities versus others became far more evenly distributed.\n\nThe sudden geographical redistribution of job opportunities was not the only element that changed, though it was the most abrupt. While there are many factors which remain the same, such as the weather, others unrelated to remote work are also changing. For example, cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles have become increasingly dangerous, crime-ridden, and overrun with homeless, while others like New York City and Philadelphia have reverted to \"run down\" chapters from their pasts. I’m not saying these cities are terrible. I enjoyed visiting both NYC and LA in the last few months and I am still somewhat biased as someone who grew up in the northeast to think there is no place like New York, but I’m less interested in living in these cities than I have been in the past, having lived in three of the four I mentioned before.\n\nSo zero income tax states like Florida and Texas have captured many of the outflows from California and New York. But the positive trends for these two states are obvious at this point. So I’m thinking about what’s less obvious. And that’s what leads me to states like Mississippi and North Carolina. But I’d be curious to hear what you think. Correct me where I’m wrong. Expand on my thesis if you can. Write a response blog, or comment in a tweet. We are only at the very beginning of the future, and I hope this is just the beginning of this discussion."}]}

Some of it I predicted in my post the day prior. Frankly, I did not expect it all to happen so quickly. We live in a world where milliseconds mean millions in the markets and any piece of information can be made accessible to anyone with internet access by anyone with internet access anywhere in the world with the press of a button. Stated more simply, money and information can move instantaneously, but other things can take time. The coronavirus, while spreading rapidly relative to the flu or other infectious diseases, of course cannot move as fast as information can today. That is to say, the coronavirus cannot go from one person to millions of people in a single moment, like a CNN headline or a Trump tweet.\n\nManufacturing masks and testing patients takes time too. Building new hospitals takes longer. Discovering a vaccine for this novel coronavirus will take significantly longer than that. But the actions that were taken yesterday by companies, schools, and other organizations around the country seemed swift, strong, and responsible. Many of them were immediate, triggered by an email sent with the press of a button, changing the daily lives of thousands of employees or students in a single moment. One could argue that some could have acted earlier, but they also could have easily acted much later or not at all. Since we really do not know how exactly this all is going to play out, it will be impossible to have known when exactly, if ever, would have been the right time to act until the consequences of acting or not acting will have already been faced, and it will have been far too late, assuming it becomes evident at that point that some action should have been taken. That is why the fact that many organizations acted at all yesterday I think is applaudable, and it is those actions that give me reasons for optimism today.\n\nSadly, I know global infections and deaths will continue to get worse. I do not know how much worse, but I know that the actions of many decision-makers yesterday have helped to make it so that it will be less worse than it otherwise would have been. That does not suggest anything about the absolute damage, but only that the relative damage will be less, and it is difficult to argue that fact. Most of these organizations will lose dollars in exchange for saving lives. They may not save an employee's life, or a student's, or a player's, but they will almost certainly save people who are degrees of separation away from those people they have made less likely to acquire and spread the infection by disallowing them from congregating together as usual for the indefinite near-term.\n\nParadoxically, it is these same preventative actions which have made it much harder to realize those reasons for optimism today. The more responsible we are as people and the more cautious we behave, the more panic it brings via the unignorable realness of the actions themselves and the very news of those actions being taken. For many people, for example, the coronavirus was something they thought little about and treated very nonchalantly until their employer told them that their office would be closed for the next few weeks at least and that they would need to effectively figure out how to work from home until further notice. Many others might have thought this was no big deal until they saw their savings in investments go way down this week, day after day after day.\n\nAs people's daily lives are changed not just by this pandemic but by the measures taken to mitigate it, and by the news cycle and financial market effects that ripple off from them, we may find a counter to a natural inclination to panic with the optimism that all of these things we are doing will make a tragic outcome at least a little less tragic than it otherwise would have been.\n\nIn some ways, this is an early demonstration of the increasingly connected world and the potential that we have to make it a better one. Individuals today by means of social media, blogs, podcasts and alike have more power to spread knowledge, information, and influence than at any other time in the history of the world. That means we all have the power with our voices to help mitigate foreseeable tragedies like the one that the world is battling today, and with our minds to pay attention to those voices, to find the ones we trust, to be skeptical but reasonable, and to choose what we come to believe. As goes the famous quote, \"With great power, comes great responsibility.\"\n\nChina and South Korea (assuming the numbers of new cases reported are reasonably accurate) have shown that we as people can move faster than the coronavirus. We can beat it, but that does not mean we will. Actions like those taken yesterday will only help our chances, and the reality is that there is no black and white when it comes to winning and losing in this matter. Like in war, we will both win in eventually gaining the upper hand, but lose in the casualties and damage suffered in the heat of battle. It is our responsibility to do that which with reasonable cost and effort we can do to limit that number of casualties and to limit the amount of damage. The way I see it, people all over the country took steps in a right and responsible direction yesterday. Those are the reasons for optimism today."}]}

The new one is called Purple People. For this podcast, I will be having conversations with some of the most interesting people on Farcaster. The only criteria is that the guest is on Farcaster. So I expect the guests and our conversations to be as wide-ranging as the people on Farcaster and their interests. Of course, there are certain areas of interest such as crypto which are common across most of the people on the network. And I expect Farcaster itself will be a frequent topic of conversation. But we will certainly not be talking about crypto or Farcaster all the time. I am much more interested in talking about all sorts of things.\n\nThe People of Farcaster\n\nThis podcast scratches two itches which I have had for at least one and three years, respectively. The first was to start a podcast focused purely on the people of Farcaster. I think Farcaster is an interesting network of people which can continue to grow in quantity while retaining some of its early community's common qualities such as civility and curiosity. Ultimately, I believe Farcaster has the potential to become the power law leading, sufficiently decentralized social network of the future. More importantly, I generally enjoy meeting and talking to new people I meet on Farcaster, and I hope to meet many more as a result of starting this podcast.\n\nWalking Recordings\n\nThe second itch was to figure out a way to record podcasts while walking outside and still retaining a high enough audio quality so as not to be less than satisfactory for the average podcast listener. I think I finally figured it out. So I plan to record most, if not all, Purple People episodes while walking outside using my Ray-Ban Meta glasses to record. If you are aware of a better walking recording device, let me know what it is. Otherwise, I am as surprised as you are to find that a pair of glasses ended up being the form factor which, after years of sporadically searching, finally seems to have satisfied my criteria for a lightweight, high-quality audio device I can use on the move. Fittingly, I was recommended the glasses by one of my good friends from Farcaster, @phil.\n\nMinimum Preparation, Maximum Spontaneity\n\nBeyond the fact that it will be focused on Farcaster people and recorded while I am walking, Purple People will differentiate from Pod of Jake in a few other ways as well. Most significantly, I will intentionally limit my preparation for each episode for the sake of enabling myself to do more of them and seeing what happens when the conversations are maximally spontaneous. Unlike an episode of Pod of Jake for which I might prepare anywhere between a couple of hours and a couple of weeks, I expect to limit my explicit preparation for an episode of Purple People to a maximum of 30 minutes. I am optimistic about how these conversations may differ as a result. I don’t know that they will necessarily be “better”, as if conversations could be judged so objectively anyway, but I do expect that they will be substantially different. I expect the increase in spontaneity to lead the conversations in less expected directions, with my questions coming more purely from a place of curiosity than an intention to drive the conversation in certain directions I have predetermined might be interesting (which, to be fair, still comes from a place of curiosity in the first place).\n\nOther Small Differences\n\nSince I will be walking while recording, I will be recording Purple Purple as an audio-only podcast just as I did for the first 140 episodes of Pod of Jake(since then, I have included video as well for most episodes). I have always preferred recording podcasts audio-only for a number of reasons, so I am excited to return to that simpler format as opposed to forcing the addition of video. Another small difference is that I will not commit to a publishing cadence as I do with Pod of Jake, where I have expected myself to publish an episode every week or two for the last 4 years, and roughly have done so with some exceptions here and there. I want Purple People to feel low pressure and just for fun. So I want to strip out any unfun parts of the process, most notably the various parts of post-production and publishing, which I mostly have minimized for my main podcast already, but will seek to do even moreso for Purple People. I don’t enjoy editing or making clips or doing the kind of overhead-type work that most people consider a prerequisite for getting an episode published. And I don't think it really matters either. So I’ll decide what matters and what doesn’t for myself and I will aim to release the conversations I record as simply and as quickly as possible for anyone who wants to be able to listen to them anytime.\n\nIn Closing\n\nI officially decided to start this podcast a week ago. Since then, I have set everything up and recorded a few episodes. My next step is to publish the first one. I could have never predicted all of the good things which have come from starting my original podcast, Pod of Jake. So now, as I start this new podcast, I am excited about the unpredictable potential for Purple People.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, you can subscribe to the Purple Peoplepodcast onApple or Spotify. \n\nThank you for reading, and if you do decide to tune in, thank you for the listening."}]}

Harvard professor Clifford Woolf sat down with a16z for a podcast (linked below) to discuss the biology of pain. Naturally, the conversation covered opioids and what some are calling an epidemic of addiction and abuse. Woolf explains how some addicts describe never feeling a high as great as the first time and how the highs become less and less powerful over time. After frequent enough use over a long enough duration, these people continue to use not so much because they crave the highs, but rather, to be saved from the lows. Maybe that is why they call it a fix. The scientific term is called withdrawal reversal.\n\nI often point to this concept of withdrawal reversal when explaining to people why I do not drink coffee daily. I typically love both the feeling and the taste — even the temperature, the act of drinking it, and the ritual itself. Still, I do not drink coffee daily because I do not believe it is a good habit, and because I do not want to be dependent on anything to maintain my normal state. With regular consumption of coffee, as with many other things, comes a growing tolerance and a lowering of the peak high feeling, but the fall of post-peak withdrawal does not become any less severe. As I understand it, the same sized fall simply starts from a lower peak until at some point the bottom of the fall is as low below your original baseline (your normal state before your coffee habit) as your original and highest peak ever was above it. At that point, your new peak is the same as your old baseline and you are no longer drinking coffee to feel better than your natural normal but simply to not feel worse.\n\nI am not necessarily advising you to stop drinking coffee daily. I think different things impact different people in different ways, and like I said, I am not a doctor. More than anything, I think the concept of withdrawal reversal and its role in the phenomenon of addiction is important to understand as it relates to everything from opioids and coffee to juul and adderall and maybe even my addiction to my phone which I imagine pales in comparison to that of many. With coffee, I have on average a cup or two a week, and I try to have it on days when I can do things that I want to do more than on days when I have things that I have to do. It feels more like a want than a need that way. My father, a doctor, often advocates for the simple sounding but challenging to abide by principle of everything in moderation. In large part because of the concept of withdrawal reversal, I believe we would be wise to strive for moderation in many areas of consumption. Now, I think I will go treat myself to a coffee today.\n\n[URL]"}]}

The \"To\" box was filled with the name of an alumnus of the school from which I had graduated seven months prior. I was in my first year of banking and hardly had time for anything extracurricular, but I have always had time for ideas. At this time, I thought I had a good one. I was writing to this alumnus because he was Head of Executive Talent at a top VC firm and I had an idea I wanted to share with someone who might get it, want to invest in it, and be able to help me. This person fit that mold. I told him in a cold email that \"I have been sitting on an idea related to your expertise in executive talent that I would very much appreciate your perspective on.\" He asked me for the details over email. I have copied that email below:\n\n> [Name],\n> \n> Thank you very much for the quick reply. I really appreciate your willingness to help and we can certainly start over email.\n> \n> I understand that you are extraordinarily skilled at identifying talented business leaders. The success of my idea would depend entirely on that skill, and that is why you are the first professional with whom I will be sharing the idea.\n> \n> A few months ago, I got to enjoy my first taste of being on the interviewer side of the table while interviewing aspiring interns and first-year analysts for our group. I very much enjoyed the experience, and I actually received unsolicited feedback from a couple of candidates saying more or less that they felt the interview really got to the core of who they were as individuals (see questions attached if interested). I was glad to learn that my top two interns were the two that were given offers, but when the prospective first-year analyst that I liked best for the one available full-time position was passed over in favor of another candidate, I was surprised by how confident I felt that she (the non-offered candidate) would have a very successful career regardless. I thought -- if this girl was a company, I wanted to invest. \n> \n> From that thought, came this idea.\n> \n> If you will give me the benefit of the doubt that there are a large number of college graduates who have a very high probability of achieving monetary success, and if you will also give me the benefit of the doubt that it is possible to identify such promising individuals with a fairly high degree of certainty, then I believe that the following idea could be worthwhile to pursue:\n> \n> POTENTIAL (working name for the firm) would provide a short-term post-graduate salary of x dollars over y years to carefully selected college students in exchange for nothing but z % of the individual's future after-tax earnings over w number of years.\n> \n> Setting the few variables to the right levels with reasonable confidence would require additional research and consideration on my part, but for the sake of providing an example, a 22 year-old Vanderbilt graduate could be awarded a $100,000 salary over two years in exchange for 3% of his or her earnings over the next 25 years thereafter. \n> \n> If the salary was instead $1 million for 5 years and the return was 1% of earnings over 10 years, I think we can both agree that that would be unprofitable for the organization and hugely and unfairly advantageous for the graduate. On the other hand, if the salary was $20,000 for 1 year and the return was 30% of earnings over 50 years, I think we can both agree that that would be extremely profitable for the organization, but no graduate in his or her right mind would apply. The very fact that there are ways to make the numbers overly favorable for each side, to me, suggests that at certain levels the deal would be both largely profitable for the organization and an extremely attractive opportunity for potential applicants.\n> \n> The organization would serve as a sort of club that would be quite exclusive to start, but scale appropriately to become larger and more popular over time. It would gain a reputation such that individuals accepted would have a \"stamp of approval\" similar to that of an out of college banker, consultant, or MBA. It would also provide a network of very successful young people, and that network and its alumni would presumably develop great relationships with VC investors and recruiters and so on. The perks would be numerous but the central idea would be that highly motivated individuals would now be given the financial freedom to spend their time after graduation as they see fit to begin a successful career without having to worry about taking an unreasonable amount of risk to do their own thing. They could use a portion of the given salary to create a start-up. They could spend their time doing research or pursuing a passion for investing. They could do community service or write a book or travel the world or they could just get a job anyway and consider it a nice bonus and an amazing network in exchange for a very marginal percentage of future earnings. The possibilities would be endless and the potential unbounded , hence the working name.\n> \n> My conviction for this idea is solidified by the fact that I would have almost certainly applied for such an opportunity if it was made available to me, and not only would I have wanted the organization to make a profit off of me in the long-run, I would have been absolutely determined to make that the case. \n> \n> In closing, thank you very much for taking the time to read this lengthy note and for your consideration of this idea. I trust that you will keep it confidential. I will very much look forward to your feedback. Thanks again.\n> \n> Best,\n> \n> Jake\n\nToday, the concept I describe where a person could accept money in exchange for a percentage of their future income has a name. It is called an income share agreement (\"ISA\"). ISAs have somewhat suddenly gained legitimate attention through their implementation at Lambda School and elsewhere. This morning, I read that Erik Torenberg and On Deck (one of two contenders which I think has the best chance to become the next generation YC, (the other being Pioneer)), is talking about launching a \"fellowship for people who want to Self-IPO\". It was Erik's article that motivated me to share my old email today. This is an idea that I have thought holds merit for years. I thought it was original when I first came up with it, but it turns out to have a history of failures. Still, I am confident that it is poised to succeed and I am hopeful that I may in some capacity be a part of the first group of people who gets it really right.\n\nI have had a number of ideas around ISAs that trace back to my initial email from nearly 3 years ago. The recipient's response to my email requested that I send him a 5-10 slide business plan. Believe it or not, I got about 90% of the way through that when my gym bag was stolen with my work laptop in it and I lost all of the files not saved to my company drive, including this PowerPoint and the supporting Excel. I was really busy with my job at the time and the realization of losing all of my work on the Potential pitch was so depressing and the thought of redoing it all so daunting that I failed to ever bite the bullet, re-do the work, and follow up with the VC. I think I have retained most of the core ideas within the larger idea but I have still yet to take the time to do the math and put it all to paper again. Maybe some day..."}]}

First people xeroxed documents and then they fedexed them and for most of my lifetime I have googled anything I wanted to know. In the last few years, many people have ubered everywhere, and that company should arguably get bonus points for having a viral rap song named after its verb.\n\nToday, while I still facetime friends & family for the most part, Zoom has emerged during this new and still somewhat foreign social distancing era as the overwhelmingly popular video communications company. Last month much moreso than ever before, we zoomed.\n\nHaving a verb or even a song named after your company, however, is no guarantee of success. Just ask Jeeves. I do not know that we will be ubering much of anywhere in 10 years either, but that is a theory to be explained on another day.\n\nToday, I am focused on the Zoom boom. In less than two months from January 27th to March 23rd, Zoom's share price more than doubled, increasing 127% from $70 to $159 while the S&P 500 dropped 31% from $3,243 to $2,237. Since then, as of today, the S&P is up 13% (for no good reason in particular) and Zoom is down 24% mostly comprised of a 6% drop yesterday and an 11% drop today. These drops came alongside stories in the news of privacy breaches and security hacks, Elon Musk's banning of Zoom use at SpaceX due to related concerns, and the introduction of a new verb that even the FBI used in a memo warning about the possibility of videoteleconference hijacking. A near but less comical cousin of the playful term photobombing, the people are calling it \"zoombombing\".\n\nToday, Zoom's Founder & CEO, Eric Yuan, addressed these concerns quickly, transparently, and seemingly carefully in a public message to zoom users. In the message, he mentioned that in March there were 20 times as many of them active on Zoom on a given day in comparison with just 3 months prior on their highest activity day in the month of December. From 10 million in December, they grew to 200 million in March (about the same as Snapchat and even more than Twitter), and while they may experience some churn (a briefer word for customer loss) as a result of these privacy and security concerns, that churn will surely be opposed by some magnitude of continued influx in users due to Zoom's significant share of the video conferencing market to which the world is shifting, which includes products from big tech companies like Microsoft's Skype, Google Hangouts, and Cisco' WebEx, as well as a number of others like BlueJeans and GoToMeeting by LogMeIn. It is difficult to know how Zoom will ultimately be affected by this privacy & security issue. There is no way to know whether it will prove to be temporary and low impact or whether it will be such a blow to the trusting relationship between userbase and company that the company will never be the same. Zoom may be doomed, but this may also just be a small hiccup in the very early stages of a much longer boom. We have seen companies in the past take publicity nightmares and apparent trust-losing events and turn them right on their heads to become trust-building events and publicity darlings. In the long run, aside from it's great start, I do not yet have much confidence in Zoom's defensibility against their several big-time competitors and the number of others which will surely arise. For this reason, and also because of the general instability of the global economy which has kept me mostly on the investing sidelines besides Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well as a single share of Amazon, I am not going to pull the trigger on buying shares of Zoom tomorrow morning, but I am counterintuitively warming up to the idea as a result of this whole zoombombing fiasco, because every obstacle presents an opportunity to show what one is truly made of. Zoom may lose the trust of its users, no doubt, but it also may respond in a way that earns their trust for the long haul, and I believe that its Founder & CEO took a step in the right direction towards doing that today.\n\nMore attractively, his letter addressing the issues revealed that the company has 20x'd its best daily active user count from last year and yet anyone with internet access can see that it is only trading 20% higher than the highest point at which it traded last year. I am practically writing myself into buying some shares but I am trying to remain patient as the gradual nature of this pandemic unfolds except for when I am all but certain in my conviction behind an investment. Generally, I would rather miss the bottom of this market than take the chance of locking up much of my money in it long before it gets there, even if that means missing out on a big chunk of the Zoom boom. Still, I am tempted."}]}

The internet led to an explosion of information. Is crypto leading to an explosion of value? \n\nInformation is infinite. But what about value? Crypto enables the definition of value where it was not previously defined. It increases the percentage of all existing value in the world that is made quantifiable and tradable. It also facilitates the creation of new value by materially decreasing the friction inherent in value creation.\n\nSo what does this mean for legacy industries where value creation is much more difficult, for companies with market caps based on multiples of hard-earned profits from “real-world” business activities? The normalized use of revenue multiples (as opposed to earnings multiples) for valuing technology companies already moved us one step away from the tangible and towards a more abstract understanding of value. Dot-com boom era multiples based on non-financial, attention-based metrics like clicks perhaps previewed an even further abstraction more representative of what’s to come. Could crypto’s impact on value do to traditional companies what the internet’s impact on information did to traditional media? \n\nThe nature of value is evolving and it is hard to wrap your head around because it hasn’t really happened yet.\n\nIt’s still just starting."}]}

For better or worse, I am not feeling that same level of concern here in Israel from the Israelis in my group nor from the group leaders, one of whom is Israeli as well.\n\nWhether the assassination was right or wrong, it seems inevitable that there will be another terrorist attack somewhere in the world and that the opposition will say that it was carried out in retaliation for the assassination of Soleimani. I just hope it is small and no time soon.\n\nRegardless of the Israelis at ease around me, to be in Jerusalem or Israel more broadly at this time of tension feels less than ideal. As America’s major ally in the Middle East, it would seem to be a natural target for retaliation. Still, I am somewhat comforted in terms of my own safety by the fact that there exist easier targets such as the Strait of Hormuz among other American targets in the region. I also understand that Soleimani will be mourned in relevant regions until his burial on Tuesday at which time I will be on a flight back to Newark, so I am optimistic that nothing will happen anywhere before then.\n\nI very much hope that nothing happens to escalate the situation at hand. It is in times like these where one can sense the grave danger of the potential for the devastating kinds of war and violence that have occurred consistently throughout the history of the world. Everything else seems to pale in comparison. Tomorrow we will be visiting Yad Vashem, the holocaust museum in Jerusalem, and bringing to the forefront of our minds a horrific time in history. No one on any side really knows what a modern war of a similar scale would look like, and my hope is that a relative state of peace will be preserved by the fact that no one on any side wants to find out."}]}

The purpose of this piece is to explain how that has happened.\n\nFirst, I want to be clear about a few ways in which I did not make money. I did not receive any government money through unemployment nor from the stimulus checks. Unemployment money is not for people who quit their jobs voluntarily and the stimulus checks were not for people who made more than $99,000 in 2019. I have not had any paid job at any point in the last 10 months. I did not start a profitable business at any point during that time. I have not made any money from this blog. My only material source of income has been through the appreciation of investments that I have made on my own, but that is not the part the matters most.\n\nThe Water Bucket Analogy\n\nWhat matters most is how I have kept from losing money.\n\nTo explain, let me introduce a simple analogy. Think about a bucket of water with a hose that fills it and a hole near the bottom where the water leaks out. The water in the bucket represents your money and the speed at which it leaks out of the hole is the speed at which your money is spent. Most people have a paying job. That’s the hose.\n\nPeople want to increase their net worth over time and so naturally they think about how they can get more water faster from the hose. The better place to start, however, is to focus on limiting the leakage. People’s general focus on the hose rather than the hole is well demonstrated by the fact that anyone you ask will be able to tell you how much money they make by some unit of time but almost no one will be able to tell you the same in terms of their costs. They probably know the cost of their rent or mortgage payments and a number of other standalone expenses (by varying units of time) but very few will be able to tell you how much money they spend on an average day including their monthly, annual, and other periodic expenses spread out over the course of the respective period. I certainly could not have answered that question myself a year ago but doing so seemed like the sensible place to start.\n\nBase Burn Rate\n\nI knew when I quit my job in banking that in order to keep my cash burn in check I would need to get my expenses in order. I had turned the hose off so I needed to manage the hole. I started with my subscriptions (monthly and annual payments). I looked at the recurring expenses on my credit card and bank statements. I cancelled almost all of them. I had to add one significant one, health insurance, which my employer had been paying previously. I went with the second cheapest plan I could find from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield for $287/month. Next time I would instead go with the second cheapest plan from Oscar for $293/month because I like newer companies in broken industries and they tend to offer a better customer experience.\n\nMy next largest recurring payment was my phone bill. I went into the Verizon store and asked what the differences were between my current plan and the cheapest one I could possibly have. The only difference of any significance was the inability with the lower plan to use a hotspot. That infrequently used function was not nearly worth the ~$80/month difference in plans. I cut my phone bill in half to $78/month.\n\nBelow are the rest of my monthly and annual expenses as they stand today. As you will see, if I didn’t actively spend any money, these passive expenses alone would result in only a $15/day average burn. I call this my base burn rate. Note: this figure was closer to $60 when I was living in New York pre-covid (+ rent, WiFi, utilities) and between $30-$60 when I was traveling in Europe and Asia (+ hostels/Airbnbs), but right now I am fortunate to be living with my family for free.\n\nNot bad right? It gets better…\n\nPassive Income\n\nI think about my investments in terms of three categories – crypto, stocks, and real estate. Real estate is unique among the three in that it pretty predictably generates cash flows each month. This is because our monthly rents collected from tenants are more than enough to cover the monthly mortgage payments, the cost of our property manager (10% of rent), and any necessary maintenance and/or repairs that she facilitates on our behalf over the course of a given month. Subtracting those expenses from the total rent collected each month and splitting the balance with my good friend and co-owner Kyle leaves me to expect $319/month (assuming the average amount of monthly repairs) which comes out to about $10/day. This is a far cry from the passive income of a real estate magnate but it is solid for a first property and not insignificant for me when it is the only dependable income that I have. Most importantly, this passive income offsets two-thirds of my base burn rate at the moment.\n\nWith my base burn rate and passive income figured out, I can calculate what I call my net base burn rate which in this case is equal to $5/day,\n\n3 Basic Principles\n\nAfter minimizing my base burn rate and estimating my passive income to calculate my net base burn rate, the next category I considered was comprised of the regularly re-occurring but variable expenses that cost me the most. This includes food, drinks, transportation, and entertainment. I came up with a few principles to help myself spend less in these areas. That said, I believe one of the best things money can buy is the ability not to have to worry about money so rather than force any hard rules upon myself I mostly just keep these principles in mind and try to be reasonable most of the time. Note: these principles were most applicable when I was traveling and then living in New York pre-covid.\n\n  1. Food – don’t drink a lot at restaurants. You are there for the food and the company.\n\n  2. Drinks – drink less and mostly at yours or friends’ places. The lower your tolerance, the cheaper the fun.\n\n  3. Transportation – walk when you can. Subways are usually quicker and always cheaper than cars.\n\n\n\n\nExceeding Expectations\n\nThe goal is not to be watching your wallet all the time. It is to figure it out, then forget about it. Knowing my net base burn rate of $5/day leads to an annual burn of less than $2,000 allows me to live and spend confidently because I know if I ever want to slow my burn I can basically do so simply by doing nothing (therefore slowing my active spending). I don’t need to drink alcohol or go golfing and I could easily eat for a few dollars per day if I was willing to eat less healthfully and not go out for a while. Fortunately, I have not had to sacrifice any of these things. If I did have to, I know that I could, but I would probably just go and get a job at that point and realistically well before that point ever came.\n\nIn order to quit my job in the first place, I had to be willing to endure some level of burn in exchange for the freedom of time that I was buying for myself. I was confident that I could offset some of it with my investments in crypto and stocks, and the non- cash flow part of my real estate investment (the appreciation of the value of my equity in the property). Never would I have anticipated what has happened to date. I am pleased to say that between Bitcoin’s surge this week, Amazon’s last month, the appreciation of my Kentucky property’s value, and some other smaller stock and crypto investments along the way, my investments have now offset the entirety of my burn over the last 10 months. My net worth is slightly greater today than it was the day I quit my job, and it is not because I’ve been a hermit or lived a miserably frugal life. Quite the contrary. I traveled the world for a few months, had a four-month lease in New York City and stayed in a couple hotels before that, got a month-long Airbnb in Georgia with Lauren, have eaten well, been golfing a lot lately, and the list goes on. Not every day is roses. I would be skeptical of anyone who says that is the case. But I have not often if ever but rarely felt restrained moneywise. I have been enjoying my time quite a bit.\n\nWhen I quit my job, I figured I would burn a good chunk of my savings in a few months and expected I would feel the need to get a job after several if not before then. I thought it would be well worthwhile to burn that money in exchange for the time that I would buy for myself to do whatever I wanted. I was right in the sense that this time has proven valuable to me but wrong in another. It hasn’t cost me a dime."}]}

I felt physically fatigued, mentally foggy, and had a slightly sore throat. I did not know if I was sick or simply worn out from running 15 miles on Sunday, lifting on Monday, and moving out of my New York City apartment on Tuesday. The apartment was a 5th floor walk-up and my brother and I must have made at least 30 round-trips up and down the stairs from the apartment to our rented U-Haul. We wore masks and gloves all day from the moment we picked up the truck to when we got home after returning it. I ran 3 miles after that as well.\n\nWednesday is usually the one day of the week that I lift weights and run, but this Wednesday I was not feeling up for either. I decided soon after waking up that I would give myself a sick day and take the day off from both. Some people think they are so tough by not taking sick days when they are not feeling well. They fail to realize that nine times out of ten their boss will get over it and everything will be fine. They pretend they are persevering because they are tough but really they lack confidence in themselves and their value. They fear the blow to their reputation they envision enduring if they show what they believe will be perceived as a sign of weakness. They want to feel needed, but no one is going to die if they miss a day. I might make an exception for a surgeon.\n\nAnyway, I am my own boss right now, and though I may be less forgiving to myself than most bosses are to their employees, I knew I needed to give myself the day. I spent all day Wednesday resting, relaxing, hydrating, and eating. I gave myself the day off of my usual weekday diet as well. I had oatmeal and toast, a can of Italian wedding soup, pasta and chicken fingers.\n\nTaking care of myself on Wednesday proved to be the move on Thursday when I woke up feeling much better and back to my normal self. It is rare that I go from feeling so poor to so fine in 24 hours but I am hopeful that it might have been a result of all of the things I have been doing this year to improve my health. Still, feeling fine I was now faced with the challenge of resuming my exercise habit as well as my weekday diet. I knew it was important after missing a day to pick it back up as soon as I could. I knew if I did not, I ran the risk of letting myself sink into a new habit of missing. If that went on for long enough, I would potentially have to build back my habits from scratch. I did not want to have to do that. It is much easier to keep doing than to start doing.\n\nHabits are always on my mind but even more than usual lately as I have been reading James Clear's book Atomic Habits , which is excellent by the way. To avoid losing a habit and having to start from scratch, James suggests the simple rule of never missing twice in a row. I think this is a fine rule most of the time but if you have the flu or something else that is fairly debilitating, not missing twice can counterproductive to recovery. That is why I consider the generally good advice of not missing twice to be more useful only in combination with another piece of habit-building advice which ensures that if you do have to miss twice, it is not over. Simply begin again.\n\nI learned the phrase \"simply begin again\" from a venture capitalist and a teacher of meditation. Thursday, I remembered it and put it to good use. I woke up, ran 5 miles, and resumed my weekday diet with a smoothie around noon. Just like that, I was back. This time, I did not need to miss twice. One day, I will. As soon as I am reasonably able, I will simply begin again."}]}

I have read writing from each of them. I have followed a number of their investments. I have listened to many of their partners speak on podcasts. As a result, I have come to value their perspectives and trust their judgements. While I appreciate that some of their individual investments will fail, I believe that their portfolios overall will continue to be extremely successful.\n\nWhen two or three of these top VCs share an investment in common, that gives me as much confidence as I could have in a company without knowing anything about it. I can then learn about the company myself in order to evaluate it from my own perspective. This is where one of my core beliefs becomes extremely important. My belief is that \"I don't know much, but at least I know that\". Knowing that I do not know much allows me to let the positive evaluations of the ultra- smart and successful venture capitalists I have come to trust carry even more weight than my own perspective. Instead of relying on my judgement about a particular asset, I can rely on my judgement of other people's judgement. I have much more conviction in that than I do in my ability to effectively evaluate a crypto-powered VPN, especially without having had the opportunity to meet the team.\n\nThat is what Orchid is. Orchid is a crypto-powered VPN. As of this past weekend, Orchid is also my largest crypto investment besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. I do not have nearly as much money in Orchid as I do in the other two for a number of reasons, but there are two big reasons why I have invested as much in it as I have. It comes down to trust and access.\n\nSequoia and Andreesson Horowitz are invested in Orchid. Sequoia, Andreesson Horowitz, and USV are all invested in a crypto investment firm called Polychain Capital. Polychain Capital is invested in Orchid too. Sequoia and USV are invested in another crypto investment firm called MetaStable Capital. MetaStable Capital was founded by Naval Ravikant whose individual investing perspective I trust similarly to many of the top partners at these top VC firms. MetaStable Capital is invested in Orchid as well. This is where I get my conviction in my investment. I understand from a very rudimentary perspective why a crypto-powered VPN could be powerful, but my conviction is not so much in the product as it is in the people who have earned my trust. My conviction is in my judgement in determining who to trust. Ultimately, it all comes down to trusting my judgment itself.\n\nWhen it comes to investing, however, trust is not the only thing that matters. Another thing that matters, unfortunately, is access. All people cannot access the same investment opportunities. Most people know Zoom by now. Most of us with access to an investing platform like Charles Schwab or Robinhood could investment in Zoom if we wanted to. We could not have invested in Zoom three years ago. It was not a public company yet. VCs like Sequoia could, and they did so at a much lower valuation than the average person ever had the opportunity to. When it comes to assets that are appreciating in value, investing earlier is better. Few people outside of investment firms and accredited investors have access to those early investments. It is a great opportunity when we do.\n\nMy access to investing in crypto comes through having a computer, internet access, and a Coinbase account. Coinbase is an exchange on which 20 different crypto assets can be traded. USV, Andreeson Horowitz, and Polychain Capital have all invested in Coinbase. I trust it for those reasons. I have also developed some level of trust in its CEO Brian Armstrong and former CTO Balaji Srinivasan. I have enjoyed Coinbase as a user and I have come to trust it to a high degree. I trust that Coinbase as an organization in aggregate knows more about the world of crypto assets than I do, many degrees of magnitude more. I trust that the crypto assets they offer on their exchange are at least not scams and at the most some of the best 20 investments out of the thousands of crypto assets that exist. Of course, just like the VCs I trust the most, I do not expect Coinbase to be perfect in all of its picks, but rather exceptional overall.\n\nBesides Bitcoin and Ethereum, I have more conviction in my investment in Orchid than in any other crypto asset. I was able to develop that conviction through trust. Conveniently, Orchid is also by far the smallest crypto asset that I have access to invest in through Coinbase. For good investments, smallness is equivalent to earliness. With that earliness comes more risk, but also multitudes more upside.\n\nTrust and access are core to what makes Bitcoin and Orchid so cool and revolutionary. They allow us to trust in peer-to-peer networks instead of institutions. In doing so, they compromise the power of those institutions and return control to the individuals themselves in many ways, including access.\n\nAnd so, it is only fitting that trust and access have become critical parts of my thesis for investing, essentially, in trust and access.\n\nNote: If you would like to create an account to invest inCoinbase or learn more about Orchid, you can follow through the links in the text of this sentence. I would receive minimal crypto rewards no different than the ones you would receive if you were to later share your links in the same way."}]}

A few of us just played our first games of pickup hoops in the Holy Land. My game was anything but holy.\n\nI did learn a few basics today:\n\n\\- 1 US Dollar equals 3.5 Israeli Shekels.\n\n\\- Israel is about the size of New Jersey, geographically.\n\n\\- “Toda” is thank you in Hebrew.\n\n\\- Jewish men and women in Israel over the age of 18 are required to serve 32 months and 24 months, respectively. This concept of compulsory enlistment is called conscription.\n\nLastly, our group leader, Dror (Hebrew for “freedom”), gave a nice talk about the importance of living outside of one’s comfort zone. He described it as a core principle of being an Israeli Jew. I have believed in and tried to live by this principle for several years now. It is essentially the action oriented equivalent of maintaining a growth mindset.

We had a great adventure of a month down in Blue Ridge, a beautiful place to spend some Spring.\n\nThe day before we left for Georgia, I wrote that I would be experimenting with Blog of Jake. That experiment is now over but my days of experimenting have only just begun. For some context, below is a brief timeline of the blog’s history so far:\n\n   12/01/19 – I begin posting once per day every weekday\n\n   02/17/20 – I begin posting The Weekend Miscellaneous every Monday, still posting every weekday\n\n   05/25/20 – I begin something different for the month instead of the usual writing, still posting every weekday\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow marks a new milestone. It is the beginning of a new chapter for the blog. It might only last a few days. It might last a few decades.\n\n   6/23/2020 – no rules\n\n\n\nNo rules means that I will write and post what I want when I want.\n\nI have written often how I hope my writing is useful, enjoyable, or otherwise impactful for you and I am pleased every time I hear from someone that it has been. Still, I have always been transparent that I am writing first and foremost for myself. It makes me think. It helps me organize my thoughts. It leads me to learn. I enjoy both the process of writing and the satisfaction of having written.\n\nWriting every weekday helped me build the habit of writing. It made me comfortable sharing my personal perspective publicly. It forced me to write on days I did not feel like writing and on many of those days I ended up writing something I was glad I wrote that I never otherwise would have written. This is a benefit of self-imposed rules. They can make you do things you will be glad you did that you never otherwise would have chosen to do, like writing when you don’t feel like it or running in the winter in the rain.\n\nAs much as I believe in making rules, I also believe in breaking them.\n\nTomorrow is my 26th birthday, a great day to make a change.\n\nI will still be writing. I will still be posting. One thing that was hard to do when I was writing every weekday was to go deeper into subjects and spend more time over a number of days writing and editing and working on the same piece. I am hoping to do some more of that.\n\nThrough great luck and a couple years of hard work, I was fortunate to be able to gift myself this time not to need to worry about making money or getting a job. That said, as the slow burn of money continues and the months since I was last employed add up, I am frequently reminded that all things are fleeting, including the nature of this particular period of my life. I am reminded of the value of the gift of freedom that I have given myself, and the fact that there are many amazing things that I can do with it.\n\nWhen all rules are removed and one no longer feels they have to do anything, one can begin to see more clearly what one wants to do simply by observing what one does. I do not know exactly how much or how little I will be writing and posting in the immediate future, but I know that I will be doing both. I already have a couple of pieces in the works that I got started in Georgia and I am excited to eventually share them with you. I believe that this is still the very beginning for Blog of Jake. This might be a good time to subscribe (just below the end of this paragraph on the left). That way, when I do post, you will not miss it. Thank you as always for reading.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nJake"}]}

You generally want to focus on high leverage activities, the kind of work that may move the needle, but when in doubt, just doing a lot of work can beat overthinking it too much, sometimes.\n\nBut at a macro level, on a multi-year scale, I think spending (investing) the time to choose what to work on is extremely important, even if that time between heads down work does not feel at all productive, efficient, or even particularly directed.\n\nIt may take many months, even more than a year for the right opportunity to present itself, and you will know it is right because it will be obvious — you won’t even think about it. You will not question whether it is right. Rather, you will think about how to make it happen. If it doesn’t actually happen, then it wasn’t actually right, but don’t assume that unless/until you have properly persisted. The most right things to work on may require significant persistence.\n\nIf you’re going to work on something basically by default for 2 years, 5 years, 10 years or more, does it seem right to spend only days, weeks, or at most a month or two (8-16% of 1 year) choosing what that main thing you’ll be working on will be? I don’t think so. If it does happen that quickly, great, but most of the urgency is arbitrary and is likely to result in settling — settling in regards to the thing you’ll spend most of your life working on for the next x years. And your work life may only be 4-5x long, maybe even shorter.\n\nIt’s hard to justify this time in advance. But you have to really believe in it, because it’s not free. You’ll be burning money. Resisting opportunities. Turning down good ones because they aren’t great. You have to trust it will all be obviously worthwhile in retrospect without being able to foresee how or why or where you’ll be after this time.\n\nWithout knowing what you are going to be working on, you have to believe it is worth waiting for, and buy yourself that precious, maybe unproductive, maybe inefficient, maybe even directionless time to find it."}]}

But it seems to me that there is some significant sacrifice required during the achievement of greatness. \n\nNo matter how many people claim they can do it all, I have doubts. Sure, Zuck and Bezos are jacked now. And yes, Steve Jobs seemed to have been a pretty good family man in the end. But these great founders were not how they later became during the years in which they rose to greatness. \n\nI’m not certain of what I am saying, that you can’t become a great founder without some significant sacrifice in fundamental dimensions of life such as health, relationships, and perhaps “happiness”. And it’s a dangerous idea if it’s wrong, because it is limiting upon one’s own idea of what is possible. I hesitate to share it for that reason. But what do I write for if it is not to share what I think?\n\nI share this idea because I am as pragmatic as I am optimistic, and this is a question I have considered for a long time.\n\nI think about it because I want to create something great, but I also want to be a great husband and a great father, and I want to live a long time, and I want to enjoy the ride. In other words, I want it all. \n\nAnd the optimist in me believes all these things are possible, together in parallel, in a single lifetime. But the pragmatist doubts whether that is true. So the optimist presses forward under the assumption that I can do it all while the pragmatist looks for signs of unavoidable sacrifice. \n\nIf sacrifice was required, and you knew that up front, at least you could make a conscious choice. More generally, if you could know what your various paths in life would look like, you could choose. But of course, you can’t. That’s not what life’s about, and I wouldn’t want it any other way. \n\nSo I move forward, knowing that I do not know, trusting my gut, and doing the best that I can.\n\nThe pragmatist started this writing but the optimist finishes. At the end of the day, I still believe it is possible that it is possible to do it all. I have my doubts, but without doubt, there is no place for faith. So that’s what I have. Faith."}]}

I imagine a small percentage of them like running in the rain. I doubt many of even those people like running in the winter in the rain, and yet that is what I did today.\n\nBelow is a picture that I took of the path along the East River that I mentioned in my post about the catching of the dog the other day.\n\nIt shows how many people like running in the winter in the rain.\n\nOnce I finished my run, I thought about whether I enjoyed running in the winter in the rain. My first thought was no, of course not. I think that was because that would be anyone normal's normal answer, but I thought about it some more. I kind of did. I enjoyed it because I knew no one else was doing it and because I was, because I believe in the running schedule I am following right now, because my legs felt good because yesterday was a rest day, and because I enjoyed the podcast with Elon Musk that I listened to during the run. As much as any other reason, I think I enjoyed it because I knew I would be glad that I did it.\n\nI have long thought about the difference between doing things I will enjoy in the moment versus doing things I will be glad I did later. Stated differently, I think about the difference between living life to enjoy every moment versus living life to be glad about what I have done with it all the way through. Ideally, the two are one in the same, but often times, they are not. I realized today that we can do typically unenjoyable things that we think we will be glad we did later, and that we can actually enjoy them because we know we will be glad we did them later.\n\nThis may be easily intuitive to some. It may even make me sound as foolish as I must have looked running in the winter in the rain today. Regardless, I think it is meaningful. I believe it is good to do things that we are confident we will be glad we did later, and to enjoy those things, for that reason alone or otherwise."}]}

Instead, I prefer to think about things for myself. That is why, after reading Matthew Walker’s excellent book, Why We Sleep , rather than trusting the National Institute of Health’s 12 Tips for Healthy Sleep which he recommends, I am creating my own guide to get better sleep. Make no mistake, my understanding of sleep has been for the most part informed by Walker's book. All I am doing is taking what I have learned from him and in the past and designing my own set of self-recommendations, overlapping with but significantly different from the NIH’s.\n\nI have long thought that around 7 hours of sleep was enough for me. After reading Why We Sleep , I am convinced that giving myself closer to a 9 hour sleep opportunity for 8 hours of actual sleep is probably best and that I am much better off sleeping more than 8 hours than even a little less.\n\nI previously wrote about how to live longer and healthier and mentioned fasting, exercise, and nutrition as the primary tenets. After reading this book, I am convinced sleep is as powerful a factor in determining a person’s healthspan as any. As such, I am determined to systematically improve the quantity and quality of my sleep for life. Here is my guide based on my current thinking about sleep:\n\nTiming:\n\nThe first change I am going to make is to get in bed a little earlier and out of bed a little later. I will aim to be asleep in the 10’s and get up in the 7’s. If I fall asleep at 10:59 and wake up at 7:00 that is 8 hours and 1 minute of sleep minus any interruptions in the night. 10:30 to 7:30 is 9 hours minus interruptions. The latter is closer to where I will aim to be. I should note that going to bed and waking up at the same time every day is the top recommendation offered by both Matthew Walker and the NIH.\n\nTracking:\n\nI am a big believer in Peter Drucker’s old saying, “What gets measured gets managed.” In order to manage my sleep for the sake of improvement, I must first find a way to measure it and to quantify that improvement. As such, I have ordered an Oura ring to help track my sleep and plan to get an Eight Sleep bed once I am settled down somewhere and sleeping in the same place more than 80% of the time again (currently writing from an Airbnb in Charleston). These two products, depending on your circumstances, seem like the best two options to me. (Clickhere if you want to listen to my podcast with Eight Sleep's Founder & CEO, Matteo Franceschetti)\n\nDrugs:\n\nIn order for a person to optimize their sleep, it is clear to me now that they would eliminate caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol entirely. For better or worse, I like all three of these things. That said, I have already been conscious about consuming them in moderation (in lower quantities and less often). In addition to maintaining moderation in my consumption, I am going to stop having coffee after 10am on the day or two per week that I do have it. If I ever had serious trouble sleeping, one of the first things I would do would be to cut these substances entirely for a few weeks and see how that helps. Do not underestimate the consequences of coffee or alcohol just because most people drink both. Most people also do not sleep as much or as well as their health could greatly benefit from doing.\n\nTemperature:\n\nMake your room colder than you think you should – 65 degrees if you are well covered with clothes and a blanket, a couple degrees warmer the less covered you are but no higher than 69. Also related to body temperature, an underrated thing that may hurt your sleep is exercising within a couple hours before bed. An underrated thing that may help your sleep is taking a hot shower or bath before bed.\n\nLight:\n\nI will make my room as dark as possible by removing all light sources and using blackout shades or a sleep mask if need be. I will not have any screens in my bedroom except for my Kindle (importantly not an iPad). I will also put my phone and laptop away by 9pm. After considering them for years, I am finally going to order blue light glasses to wear after sunset whenever I am looking at screens and maybe just generally as night glasses.\n\nNaps:\n\nI am going to continue napping more often, usually for between 20 minutes and an hour, usually not after 3pm, and especially after nights when my sleep tracker says I did not sleep as well, when I feel tired, or otherwise not 100%.\n\nLastly, there are a few things that I either do anyway or that are not relevant for me that I will note in case they may be relevant for you. \n\n   Exercise for 30 or more minutes everyday\n\n   Get outside for 30 or more minutes of sunlight everyday\n\n   No late night eating\n\n   No alarm clocks unless needed and no snooze button or multiple alarms regardless\n\n  * No prescription medications before bed that could interfere with sleep (ask doctor)\n\n\n\n\nIn closing, I have written the above guide not to be followed by myself or others in its entirety, but rather as an informal (and I should note, unprofessional) resource for myself and others to turn to if and when we want to improve our sleep from its existing state, regardless of what that state may be. I am already going to be dedicating more time to sleep itself so I do not want to spend a ton of additional time beyond that thinking about sleep and worrying about what to do to get more of it. For whatever it is worth, I think that constantly thinking about all of this stuff, especially once in bed, could probably be counterproductive in the same way that thinking about all the aspects of your golf swing while you do it can end up with your ball in the bushes. That said, I am excited to start experiencing the benefits, conscious and otherwise, of allowing myself to sleep more in general. I am also excited to start tracking my sleep with an Oura ring and eventually an Eight Sleep bed. I am going to sleep at a colder temperature, keep my screens out of my room, nap more, see if I like wearing blue light glasses at night, and consider some of the other tips that I listed above if I ever find myself wanting to do more to improve my sleep. I will also continue keeping an eye on the things that could compromise my sleep most such as a warm bright bedroom, caffeine, or alcohol. \n\nI want to share one final message based on a valuable takeaway from Walker's book which offered dozens that I have not mentioned above and which, if it is not abundantly clear, I highly recommend -- Do not drive drowsy. It can be just as bad and even worse than driving drunk and it is often deadly. I have powered through the highway drowsies myself in the past. It is not worth it. Just don't do it."}]}

That's because, as it stands, laws are a function of latitude and longitude. But what if we could unbundle the age-old tie between the land and the laws? Could there be a way to achieve a fresh slate without fresh land, sea, or space?\n\nThe tie between land and laws makes complete sense in the physical world. But it makes little to no sense in the digital world. The internet is inherently global. \n\nFundamentally, laws are meant to govern how people interact, whether that’s individual people, organizations of people, or governments of people -- it’s all just people. So there was really no need for someone in America and someone in Australia to recognize the same laws a couple hundred years ago. They would be very unlikely to ever interact. \n\nToday things are much different. Many of us spend as much or more time interacting with people in the digital world as in the physical world. On Twitter, I am far more likely to meet and message with someone from Australia than I am to meet and message with someone from the apartment building that I live in — that would just be an insane coincidence.\n\nSo just like it made sense to have local laws based on the land, to set the ground rules for the interactions most likely to occur due to physical proximity, now, on the internet, it makes sense to have “local laws” for the interactions most likely to occur in the digital world, due to digital proximity. That could mean laws by platform (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), laws by cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), or laws by something else entirely, like a digital-first network state, which may acquire some land, though it will hold most of its clout in the cloud.\n\nPlatform \"laws\" and cryptocurrency \"laws\" already exist in a sense, but they are not seen as sitting at the same level as national laws. They are seen as either downstream or independent, but as the power dynamics change, so too could the power ranking of rules.\n\nIt’s a hazy view, but if you squint you can see it. The opportunity to innovate at unprecedented speeds awaits us. We simply need to effectively innovate on the way in which we regulate."}]}

This was raised from a maximum age of 26 in 2017. The program was founded in 1994, the year I was born.

Saturday night after Havdalah (the end of Shabbat), we celebrated the beginning of a good week (“shavua tov”) with a surprisingly fun night out at the Mahane Yehuda Market. For food, I would recommend both Jachnun Bar and Basta Pasta in the market if you ever find yourself in the holy city. The party requires no recommendation as it was primarily in the streets of the market. You just have to walk towards the music.\n\nIn the morning we visited the Western Wall. This was one of my favorite stops of the trip. As is tradition, I wrote a prayer on a piece of paper, folded it up small, and shoved it into a crevice between the large rectangular rocks of the ancient wall. Jews have prayed at the wall for hundreds of years, not because it is the holiest place but because it is the holiest place they are allowed. The Temple Mount enclosed within the wall is the most sacred place to Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike, but an Israeli told me that if a Jew tries to pray under the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount he or she should expect to be tackled immediately.\n\nLater in the day we had a guided tour through Yad Vashem, the holocaust museum in Jerusalem. It reminded me of my visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum a little over a month ago and was as sad and impactful as one would expect. Mount Herzl, Israel’s national cemetery, brought all of that closer to home the following day as we tried to sympathize with Israelis in our group who cried in their continued mourning of friends who tragically lost their lives in the military and through despicable acts of terror. It is so impossibly difficult to process the the fact that more than 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. It was hard enough hearing just one story about the death of a friend of one of our Israeli friends at the hands of terrorists. The only parts I could read on the Hebrew tombstones were the numbers representing the ages at death of the deceased. The average age was younger than I am now. I guess it should not have been a surprise given the years of required service as a young adult, but I did not expect to see row after row of tombstones with ages 19, 23, 21, 17, 20, 22, etc.. You never want to see that.\n\nI finally arrived home this morning after a 12 hour flight from Tel Aviv. I was fortunate to sleep for the majority of the flight despite sitting next to a family with two babies and two other young kids. It was the best test yet for the noise-cancelling capabilities of my AirPod Pros and they passed with flying colors.\n\nDespite my general preferences against rules and strict, not self-imposed schedules, I found the birthright trip to be a valuable and certainly worthwhile experience. I really felt I got to know Israel and thoroughly enjoyed many aspects of the country and its unique culture. I was even considering staying in Tel Aviv for a couple of extra nights on the back end of the trip but decided not to, partly because of what is going on with Iran. Iran’s act of retaliation in Iraq this evening added conviction to my sense that I was making the right decision coming home. I am pretty confident I will make it back to Tel Aviv for some more time another time anyway."}]}

In total, that is 6-8 hours of screen time every day between those two devices. I have not been using my computer much except for writing so I am not concerned with including that Screen Time for now. What I am concerned about is that I am spending almost or exactly half of my waking hours (16) on these stupid smart devices. On my deathbed, I cannot imagine looking back and being glad that I spent almost half of my twenties on an iSomething screen. The very fact that such a time suck is possible is why I consider the iPhone and iPad to be so addictive. It is why I set my iPhone to greyscale. I often notice when I am feeling unusually down or stressed for no reason that it is correlated with my screen time (iPhone worse than iPad worse than computer). Last night I decided it is time to make a change.\n\nI took some time to write down most of what I do on my iPhone and iPad versus what I want to do on them. In other words, I wrote down my current use versus ideal use and then designed a path to implement the desired change. I have been spending most of my screen time on Twitter, Safari, Messages, and Superhuman (email), with a lesser amount of time on a handful of other apps as well. On Safari, I am often keeping both literal and figurative tabs on stock prices and news and Coinbase to keep an eye on my cryptocurrencies. I have fallen into an old habit of bouncing around between sites like ESPN, CNN, CNBC, and my old friend Yahoo. It feels ridiculous to be finding myself on ESPN so often when there are literally no sports on these days. Nonetheless, let me briefly explain the initial solution that I have designed.\n\niPhone - I put the Podcasts, RunKeeper, Notes, and Clock apps in the bottom bar. I will aim not to use my phone for any app outside of that bottom bar except for once or twice a day during designated screen time. I have yet to specify what that will be but it should not end up being longer than 30 minutes or an hour in total. I moved Twitter and Safari off of the first page to be less tempting. From previous changes to my phone, my notifications are off for practically everything, the colors are set to greyscale, and the screen is relatively uncluttered. You can see screenshots of my first and second screens on my iPhone below (note: screenshots on greyscale still show the colors).\n\niPad - Same thing, different apps. I put the the Books, Spotify, Notes, and Calendar apps in the bottom bar. The objective is to limit all use outside of reading and music. Again, I moved Twitter and Safari to the second page. I do not have my iPad on greyscale because it feels almost criminal to rob the beauty from such an aesthetically pleasing machine, but perhaps I will consider it. Same rules apply. I will aim only to operate outside of the bottom bar apps during designated iPhone/iPad time. The 30 minutes to an hour that I referenced above includes both devices and most of that should be spent on the iPad because it is better in every way unless I am on the go. You can see a screenshot of my iPad below. You might recognize the background.\n\nI do not want to spend one half or even close to one quarter of my waking days texting or on Twitter or the internet or habitually checking Instagram, Snapchat, GroupMe, stock prices, Coinbase, CNBC, ESPN, CNN, and Yahoo. Who cares about any of that? It is all junk food for the mind. When I get rid of it, I expect to notice that real food will start to taste better again. The natural sugars of an apple. The natural joys of reading a good book, writing with pen and paper, or simply being outside.\n\nMaybe this is the change that will finally move me to call my friends more. That should be allowed outside of screen time as well. There is a reason we spend so much time on these devices. They are amazing, in moderation. Too much of most anything is a bad thing and several hours on these devices feels like far too much. I am excited to make this change and see it how it goes. I am excited to see what my days will be like with several more hours in them. Even if I were to literally sit and do nothing, I have long believed it is better to do nothing than to do nothing on one's phone. Let the experiment begin."}]}

Many people have told me I am this way. One of my principles is that definitions are limiting. As such, I hesitate to even identify as a principled person, but I know it is generally true.\n\nAs a person who believes in principles, I tend to admire other people who are principled. As I mentioned in my last blog, I am currently reading The Score Takes Care of Itself by Bill Walsh. Bill’s book is practically a collection of principles. I am reading it partly because it is one of the top two books I have heard recommended by Keith Rabois who I am scheduled to have on the podcast tomorrow. Keith talks about first principles all of the time and clearly has used them to his advantage as a prolific operator and investor. Even as I am writing this piece now, I am doing so in large part because of a principle I learned from Naval Ravikant, a wise person who like Bill and Keith is well known for his principles. Naval once tweeted, “Inspiration is perishable - act on it immediately.” In my head, before looking it up to quote Naval verbatim, I had turned this into, “Seize inspiration immediately.” Either works.\n\nAnyway, I was reading Bill’s book quite contently out in the South Carolinian shade of a tree on a chair by a dock on a river when his reference to “an insatiable hunger to capture inspiration and answers that all highly driven people share” sparked inspiration in me to write. My monkey brain said to keep reading and that I could write about it later but my logic recognized that if I did not write now I might never and that, even if I did, it would likely feel like work then whereas it would feel like play now. Any action on inspiration is enjoyable in a way which nothing on a to-do list can usually compare.\n\nFunny enough, the thing I was inspired to write about is something that I have not even gotten to yet. Perhaps subconsciously I have dangled it out in front of myself like a carrot, using the inspiration to write about this thing as an inspiration to write generally until I felt that well of inspiration running dry and decided finally it was time to broach the subject that inspired me to write in the first place. That subject is defined by the second word in the quote that I mentioned from Bill’s book – “insatiable”.\n\nThe word insatiable may be insignificant to most but it holds a great deal of meaning in my mind. As far as I can remember, it was the first word I really liked for my answer to the question of “What is one word you would use to describe yourself?” I may be mistaken but I believe the first time I was asked to consider that question was while applying to a few private high schools. If that is true, I believe it is also true that I responded with the word insatiable. I remember my mother encouraging me to find a better word because the word insatiable to her had some negative connotations. She was not wrong. I have argued from a logical standpoint that there is no such thing as good or bad. This is the same as suggesting that all things are good and bad. Even easier than that argument, however, is the argument that the attribute of insatiability is both good and bad. In case this is not obvious, I will go ahead and explain it.\n\nAs my title suggests, I believe insatiability is both a blessing and a curse. It is a double-edged sword which must be wielded carefully. It can make you or it can break you. I am not sure I could escape it so I choose to embrace it. The benefits of insatiability are plentiful. It is the root of all drive and sets the aim of ambition. \n\nAs an insatiable person, I am almost never satisfied. When rarely I am, it is a feeling that is all too fleeting. There is always something to be improved or something greater to do next. For the insatiable person, achievements are merely means to endlessly ambitious ends. The blessing is the relentless persistence powered by the lack of satisfaction. The curse is the persistent lack of satisfaction itself. This is why I say insatiability is a double-edged sword which must be wielded carefully.\n\nI am still young and figuring things out, opening the door of my mind to you as best I can as I do so, but I think it is important to remember that the sword is for using rather than to use you. To let the sword use me would be to let it drive me into the ground. It would likely lead to fighting and losing a battle versus depression. It would lead to living a lousy life but one of considerable accomplishment in some narrow area or two to which my insatiability by happenstance became applied, like banking for example. \n\nI went into banking after school because I viewed it as the best opportunity to begin a career in business, because it paid well, looked good, and offered the opportunity to learn a lot, among other reasons. In banking, as in any environment, many people share similar perspectives and aspirations and both become more difficult not to subconsciously conform to as you are continuously exposed to them day in and day out. I have no doubt that my insatiable nature could have led me to work insanely hard for years on end to become a Managing Director without ever realizing that my insatiable nature was driving me to advance further and further in a game that I never actually wanted to play. Some people like that game and that is fine for them but it became evident to me in just a couple of years that it was not the game I wanted to play even though I was fortunate enough to be granted a slot in the race. I am thankful that I was able not only to recognize that fact but to act on it and quit without the reason that most have to do so, because they have another job lined up. \n\nTo use the sword rather than to be used by it means to choose when to unsheathe it. In other words, it means to choose your battles wisely. It stands to reason that if you do well in the best battles, you will do well in the war, and though there may be no way to ultimately win for the person who is so insatiable it could be considered a sin, I do believe that satisfaction is a spectrum and that even the most insatiable person can find themselves on the good side of the line even if they can never get to the absolute end.\n\nThis is all nice for me to write and think about but there are some practical measures worth mentioning in addition to the somewhat philosophical ways of thinking about insatiability that I touched on above. If one is to use their insatiable nature to their own benefit, they must learn to protect from the downside of the double-edged sword beyond simply learning where best to apply the upside. It is naturally unpleasant to be insatiable. If given the choice to be satisfied or unsatisfied in a given moment, no sane person would choose the latter. Though insatiability can be helpful in the long-term, it is never desirable in the moment, and so one must choose gratitude which, if granted full focus of the mind, cannot be interrupted by insatiability, as hard as it may try. One must have the will power to overcome one’s own nature on occasion so as to balance the scales a bit and counter the compulsion to be dissatisfied. I aim to accomplish this mostly through my morning journal which gives me at least a few minutes of positive thinking and gratitude every weekday, and in maintaining a generally positive mindset. Meditation would probably help too.\n\nIn closing, it is worth mentioning that there is no easy solution for the person with the power and problem that is insatiability. There are some helpful frameworks as I have endeavored to write a bit about above, but there is no easy answer. As with most things, the answer lies somewhere in the balance and the scales are never still, especially for the person who is hardest to be satisfied."}]}

I watched his first two few-minute stints of underwhelming playing time before boring of what was at that point a one-sided game between two non-playoff teams.\n\nIt turned out that I turned off the TV too soon. Zion dropped 17 consecutive points in just over 3 minutes at one point in the 4th quarter. According to Elias Sports, he achieved records for the most consecutive points scored by a rookie in the 4th quarter (17), the most 3's made without missing in a player's debut (4), and the most points scored in under 20 minutes in a player's debut since the shot clock was invented in 1954 (22).\n\nBased on the records or headlines alone, one might assume Zion's debut was near perfect. People who believe he was the best player in last year's draft might even prematurely say \"I told you so\". Ultimately, everyone should know that one game is not nearly enough to determine how a player's career will be, but that will not stop some people whose thesis on Zion was supported by his debut from citing it as such.\n\nThe misleading part about using the headlines and the records as support in this instance is the means by which Zion accomplished the stats. He did not score 17 points in 3 minutes using his absurd athleticism, combination of speed and size, or jumping and dunking abilities, spare one impressive alley-oop layup. The rest of his 17 points were comprised of making 4 wide open 3's, 1 of 2 free throws, and a put back layup from his own blocked shot.\n\nDo not get me wrong. It was an exhilarating few minutes of play to watch and I was happy to see Zion take over the game. At the end of the day, the numbers are the numbers and no matter how you put them up they are impressive. Still, this was not \"Zion being Zion\" to put up those numbers. This was Zion knocking down wide open 3's, making one Zion type play (the alley-oop), one hustle play (the putback), and missing half of his free throws (an issue that could become significant for him in the future if not improved from the 64% he shot from the line in college). Speaking of college stats, Zion made 33.8% of his three point shots in college, a rounding exercise from LeBron's 34.3% shooting from beyond the arc this year. You certainly do not see teams giving LeBron wide open looks from 3, let alone four of them in a row. Sufficed to say, teams will know to guard Zion from 3 point land after last night.\n\nI am not making any predictions about Zion's career. Contrary to the sentiment of my writing to temper what I believe is a somewhat unwarranted level of hoopla around his debut, I am generally optimistic about what his career will look like. I do think that, barring injuries, Ja Morant will end up being the best player from the 2019 NBA Draft, and I am skeptical about Zion's ability to be \"the guy\" on a championship team, but only time will tell. For now, I am rooting for Zion, Ja, RJ, and all the rest of these young players. I am looking forward to hopefully seeing a lot more of them in the playoffs in years to come, when I tend to watch a lot more NBA basketball than I do during the regular season."}]}

If the same has been true for you, you do not have to read this. You have probably come to your own set of conclusions based on a large set of information already. I do not yet have any great advice for people like you and I who have a hard time turning a blind eye to this. In case, however, you have mostly tuned out the news or even if you have not but you have come to trust my perspective and reasoning to some degree, I feel compelled to share a brief update on how I see the state of play today in regards to the coronavirus.\n\nOne could justifiably ask why I should feel any right to opine on something that I am not by any means an expert about. I would answer that, first of all, I am not advising the UN here, second of all, you do not have to listen, and third of all, I do not see much negative that could come from what I am about to write. I am simply sharing my writing on something with a group of people who read what I write presumably because they find some value some of the time in some of the things that I write.\n\nSo here it goes...\n\nHarvard and Amherst, arguably the top university and liberal arts college in the nation, respectively, have both told their students not to return to campus after Spring Break. They plan to complete their semesters remotely. Others will follow these leaders in the next two weeks.\n\nGoogle, Twitter, Amazon, Microsoft, and JP Morgan have told their employees (in certain locations at least) to work from home. Others will follow these leaders in the next two weeks.\n\nEvents like SXSW and BNP Paribas Open have been cancelled too. Soccer games in Europe have been cancelled or played without crowds. Other events will soon be cancelled in mass. It seems more likely than not that there will be some March Madness games played in empty arenas.\n\nWhether this all proves to be an overreaction, an appropriate one, or too little too late may currently be indeterminable, but the reaction itself now seems more or less inevitable.\n\nPrepare for the reality of this seemingly probable reaction. Even if you do not think it is inevitable, assign a different than 100% probability to it and operate with the probability of that reality in mind.\n\nThere is usually little or no penalty for being overly cautious for a relatively short period of time to prevent a potentially long and detrimental set of consequences.\n\nI am concerned at this point that it may become very difficult to prevent widespread panic as the above reactions come to fruition, whether or not the reality of the virus will warrant such a level of panic. One of the ways I can think of to prevent panic at the individual level is with preparation.\n\nIn terms of preparation, this week I am going to begin building a 2-3 week supply of nonperishable food that I would eventually eat anyway if it is not needed sooner than later in an Italy-like situation or worse. It is critical to appreciate that the reason I am doing this is not because I necessarily think I will need it. Rather, I am doing this because I acknowledge that there is a small chance that I could need it and I do not see any costs or downsides to doing it other than the acceleration of a few weeks worth of minimal food costs (which most people can afford without trade-offs) and being viewed by others as gullible or straight up stupid to believe all of the “media hype”. If you care much about that, you can just keep it to yourself. If I cared much about that, I would not be writing this.\n\nIn terms of avoiding public areas and crowded places, I am using some level of caution about touching subway handles for example, but I am not yet actively avoiding these areas until the number of infected people in New York gets greater. For example, I played basketball in a local school gym yesterday, took the subway there and back, and plan to do the same to go see the Big East Tournament in Madison Square Garden tomorrow night. As the virus continues to spread locally, which I assume it will, I plan to monitor it relatively closely and gradually change my approach regardless of government restrictions as the situation changes. This realm of decisions is more difficult to deal with because the cost of isolationism over the extended period of time that the virus is likely to be around can have a relatively large impact on quality of life and could be regrettable if it is all for naught. That is to say, in this case there is a cost and a downside. My thinking at this point is that if I were to get the virus at this relatively early juncture, which has a very low probability of happening from my perspective, I would isolate myself as soon as I felt off in the slightest, and while the overwhelming likelihood would be that I could take care of myself to get back to good health, if I did unfortunately need urgent care at any point, the hospitals are not yet being tested in their capacities and I could be treated without much likelihood of any issues and without taking a hospital bed from an older or less healthy person who could be waiting to get one after me.\n\nAnother costless precaution that I am taking is to wash my hands more and try to have more awareness about their cleanliness and about touching my face and biting my nails. The latter I have done for the majority of my life and I am not so foolish as to think that I could break the habit overnight if the time does come that I would be well-advised to. Again, there is no downside here and so doing the smart thing becomes a why not option with minimal effort required. Consequently, if I increase my awareness and stop biting my nails as a result of all of this, that would actually be great.\n\nI may be very wrong about any or all of this, and I may be overly cautious and over-preparing. I certainly hope that is the case and I think that the odds are probably decent that it is because I recognize that I have a bias towards being risk-averse when the worst case scenario is a grave one and the chances of it happening are not worth testing. The thrill of risking life is not alone worth the risk of life to me, and though the reality is that our lives are always at risk, any reward that can be gained by adding to that risk is less frequently worth the deal to me than it is to most.\n\nIn conclusion, I would much rather be ready and wrong than unready and right."}]}

McConaughey talks about the reasons he started keeping a diary, a practice that he views as a positive one and one which has persisted in his life for decades. I realized then that, while I have written about things as inconsequential as the correct way to eat nigiri, I have never written explicitly about why I write a double-spaced page in a journal every weekday morning and have done so for the majority of the last few years since I graduated college.\n\nThe purpose is pretty simple really. I believe that in starting my day by putting positive words to paper, my perspective throughout the day becomes that much more positive. My journaling practice is intentionally short and sweet. Some say the best workout is the one you will do everyday. I believe the same is as true with most habits. My morning journal takes me between two and a few minutes and consists of filling 15 lines (each with an empty line in between) in a 5 by 8 Moleskine, plus usually one more line in the bottom margin as I always have something more to be grateful for by the time I get to the bottom.\n\nIn terms of logistics, I always top the page with the date written out like, \"October 27, 2020\". In the top right corner, as of this year, I have started writing the number of the day of my life. This gets tricky sometimes after not writing over weekends or missing a day here and again but I believe today is my 9,623rd day (I just write \"9623\"). As a matter of fact, I just double checked that here for the first time since I started and it's still exactly right. I suppose the math is actually not that hard...\n\nThe average life expectancy for a man in the USA is roughly 30,000 days. Perhaps because our ages in years carry with them certain associations of what it means to be in one's twenties or forties or sixties, I find that the day count puts the length of one's life into better perspective. It becomes clear in writing that I am on my 9,623rd day that I am a third through the average life, and though I am optimistic that healthspans are poised to increase substantially in the coming decades, I also believe in the benefits of keeping one's mortality in mind. The best way to live today is to remember that you could die tomorrow. In the words of the Ancient Romans, \"Memento mori.\" In the words of Don Draper, \"I'm living like there's no tomorrow, because there isn't one.\" In the words of Steve Jobs:\n\n> “Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. \n> \n> Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. \n> \n> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. \n> \n> No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.”\n> \n> Steve Jobs\n\nOnce I date and day my journal, I always start it almost the same. \"Today is going to be a _ day.\" The word above the line can change but I would be hard-pressed to go through my hundreds or thousands of entries and find a word any less positive than \"good\". After that first line, I fill the rest of the page with positive thoughts, expressions of gratitude, hopes and intentions for the day, thanks for the highlights of yesterday, and whatever else comes to mind. Not every sentence is always positive but most are and almost none are negative though they may be neutral. Rarely do I take the pen off the paper in between the first sentence and the last. This forces a stream of positive consciousness.\n\nSometimes, I write things that are not necessarily true in an effort to make them true. For instance, if my back hurts, I might write, \"my back feels good today\". If it actually feels good, I would probably write that it feels great. Pain is in large part mental anyway. When it comes to my journal, negatives become positives and positives are pushed as far as possible. There may be something to be said for a journal that spends more time writing about struggles and such but if someone were to look back and read all of my journals they would not find any of that. When it comes to my morning journal, I write like I am the luckiest man in the world. The more I write it, the more it seems to be true.\n\nI will end this post the way I often start my morning journal. Today is going to be a great day."}]}

See It Now was a documentary series broadcast by CBS from 1951-1958 with host Edward Murrow. This particular program focused on the stock market and featured a classroom Q&A at Columbia University with Professor Benjamin Graham. Graham, often called \"the father of value investing\", is best known as Warren Buffet's mentor and author of the book, The Intelligent Investor. I have transcribed the three quotes that I found most interesting below in case you are not interested in watching 1950's black and white programming hosted by a man with a cigarette in hand and interrupted by commercials from The Aluminum Company of America.\n\nBenjamin Graham on dollar cost averaging (the strategy of investing a set amount of money in an asset at regular time intervals to neutralize short-term fluctuations in the price, a strategy which I am presently employing with Bitcoin and would consider for stock purchasing in the future):\n\n\"I think there’s no doubt accepting your premise that a man who would put the same amount of money in the market year after year for the next 20 years let’s say has a very good chance of coming out ahead regardless of when he begins and particularly regardless of whether he should begin now. You have to allow for the human nature factor that no man can really say definitely just how he is going to behave over the next 10 or 20 years and there is danger that people who start with the idea of being systematic investors over the next 10 or 20 years may change their attitude as the market fluctuates and, in the first instance, put more money into the market because they become speculators, and secondly, get disgusted and scared and don’t buy at all later on when prices get low. It’s a psychological danger. The fault is not in the stars or the system but in ourselves I think.\"\n\nBenjamin Graham on why the predictions of Wall Street experts are not more dependable:\n\n\"Everybody on Wall Street is so smart that their brilliance offsets each other, and that whatever they know is already reflected in the level of the stock prices pretty much and consequently what happens in the future represents what they don't know.\"\n\nEdward Murrow in closing the program:\n\n\"[The stock exchange] remains the subject of curiosity and concern as to whether what is good for the exchange is good for the country and the people who live here. There have been no official charges that it has been rigged or manipulated but rather the question of whether or not the market is healthy. There is wide disagreement amongst the experts as to why the market behaves as it does but there is considerable agreement that it behaves the way it does because people behave the way they do. Good night and good luck.\""}]}

This is the \"quitting cold turkey\" equivalent for getting unaccustomed to your high cost of living lifestyle. It works especially well if you are single, don't own a house, and have a lease ending soon or can break it.\n\nPack a carry-on and a backpack. Cancel all your subscriptions and everything you don't need while you're away. Try to live for under $100 per day.\n\nThe goal is not to live that way forever (neither traveling, nor living for under $100 per day). Rather, it is to show yourself that you can enjoy life without most of the things you thought you needed to be happy.\n\nWhen you get back from your travels, think about what you actually need and what is important to you. Design your life and cost of living intentionally. Don't just go back to your old setup and let costs rise accidentally.\n\nI did this and went from paying monthly rent of $3,600 for a luxury studio to $1,200 splitting an apartment with my brother, both in NYC -- super easy after the above. That was a few years ago, but this really worked for me. If you want to escape golden handcuffs, or simply reset your cost of living, I hope it works for you too."}]}

I have considered the question, \"but what to build?\"\n\nIt seems natural that I would want to build something that is valuable and lasting. But then again, even the greatest castles are ultimately proven to have been built of sand. In the eternity of the universe, I am aware that all will be washed out by the waves of the ocean eventually. Still, this knowledge is not enough to stop me from wanting to build something valuable and lasting. It is only enough to urge me to consider a third factor which should be prioritized as well, that is, my enjoyment of the ride. It may be convenient then if it is true what Steve Jobs said, that \"the only way to do great work is to love what you do.\" I, for one, believe it.\n\nSo beginning with the consideration of value and longevity, how can one project the ultimate value of something that they might consider building? I actually think the common definition of lifetime value (\"LTV\") which subscription software businesses use to measure the projected value in dollars to be received from their customers over the course of their lifetimes (as customers) presents a reasonable formula, conceptually at least. Basically, I believe it is helpful to think of the ultimate value of something as the product of its projected average value per unit of time multiplied by the projected duration of its existence (the total units of time for which it is projected to survive).\n\nThe contrast in prioritizing one side of this equation versus the other can be demonstrated by the difference between two hypothetical builders, each of which could be connected to reality by multiple examples throughout history. The first is the epic entrepreneur who builds an amazing company without an effective enough succession plan to prevent the company's demise soon after his or her own. The second is the amazing artist whose work fails to gain acclaim within his or her lifetime but physically outlasts them and gains such appreciation in the eyes of its evolving audience that posthumously the artist and his or her work become world-renowned and persist to offer value, for example, to visitors in museums around the world. Together, the museums have given the artist's work something much nearer to immortality than was ever had by the entrepreneur's long ago bankrupt business, but some businesses do become extremely valuable for a certain period of time, and many artists never are materially discovered, before or after their deaths.\n\nTo provide a related example illustrating the nature of value, I would argue that fire may be one of the most valuable inventions of all time, not because it is insanely valuable in every instance it is used, such as to roast a marshmallow, but rather because its usage has persisted for so long and for so many fundamental purposes which could not have been achieved without it.\n\nTo consider a widespread creation that was not very valuable because of its failure to survive, Myspace may have seemed valuable to many people for a brief time, but its ultimate value in sum was compromised by the fact that the product did not endure. In fact, one could argue that Myspace's most valuable function in the end was in the way that it helped clear the path for Facebook, which again seems valuable now, but likely will seem less so in a few years, decades, or centuries, depending on how long its relevant lifetime will be.\n\nThe idea of periodic value is not limited to social media companies. Do you know how much Alcoa Steel is worth today? How about Exxon? Exxon was the most valuable company in the world just 10 years ago and today it isn't even worth half of Tesla in terms of market cap. Companies like these which were once among the largest and most important in the world are now less relevant and less valuable and may even be counterproductive in some ways by the stubbornness of their incumbency.\n\nAll of that said, it seems to me that the most persistent things which people have built in the history of the world have been architectural and written. Perhaps it is no coincidence that some of the very oldest texts in the world are the Pyramid Texts, inscribed on the walls of an Egyptian period roughly 5,000 years ago. Perhaps it is no coincidence either that the English phrase used most often used to describe something as permanent or everlasting is to say that something is “written in stone”.\n\nPerhaps I am in need of more humbling, but the truth is that I am confident I could build a successful company if I wanted to. In the last year alone, I have probably had a dozen fundamental ideas for companies which I think would have reasonable chances to succeed. Still, I cannot help but question what the point would be if they were not to last well beyond my lifetime and if I were not to enjoy the ride more than the one I am on now -- reading, writing, podcasting, and all the rest.\n\nIt seems that if I want to build something that will last, I am doing so in this very moment by writing. It seems too that the internet has introduced a new universe of that which will last, and though the company Facebook may not, any content (like a podcast, for example) which is sufficiently spread beyond centralized platforms should survive in perpetuity as well. In the history of humanity, there may have been nothing more lasting one could do than to build with, or write in, stone. Perhaps now, the most lasting thing one can do is to write and record conversation and to otherwise build in a decentralized manner which could live possibly forever on the internet."}]}

From now on, I will be focused on something new. It is called [x].\n\nI recently started working full-time on [x] as a part of the founding team. It is not uncommon for people to say that they have come upon a dream opportunity. Well, this was an undreamable opportunity for me.\n\nI could never have imagined all that has happened since I quit my job in investment banking about a year and a half ago. At the time, I had basically no idea about anything that I was going to do next. All I really had was a one-way ticket to Italy and the confidence that I could figure things out from there. I trusted that the dots would connect in my future, and that everything would work out in the end. Now, as I turn the page to my next chapter, I can see clearly that it has.\n\nI am more excited for this next chapter than I have been for any chapter at any time in my life. As I close this past chapter and get ready to begin anew, I cannot help but to feel extremely fortunate and incredibly grateful. I feel like I am exactly where I am supposed to be, doing exactly what I am supposed to be doing. I often think about the butterfly effect, the idea that small and seemingly meaningless decisions can change the rest of one’s life completely. I feel now as if everything I have ever done and every decision I have ever made was worthwhile because it brought me here to where I am now, and there is nowhere I would rather be. To me, it goes to show the benefit of believing that everything happens for a reason, that if you seek to make the best of things, if you keep a positive attitude, if you stay patient and persistent, and if you have faith, it all works out in the end.\n\nOf course, this is only the very beginning of my story, but it is also the end of a chapter and the culmination of all those that came before it. I think about my most recent chapter in three parts. I first spent a couple of months traveling, then several months writing, and finally several more podcasting. Not to suggest that I did not have any down days along the way – like everyone, I did – but generally speaking, I loved all of it. I got to explore Paris, Copenhagen, Japan, and Israel. I got to write this blog that thousands of people from over 100 countries cared to read. And I got to record more than 50 podcasts with some truly amazing guests, which I expect to continue to do, only at a slightly slower pace.\n\nA few other themes from the last year come to mind. I picked up the habit of running and ran over 600 miles last year, including my first marathon on my 26th birthday. I got accustomed to a much lower cost of living which helped me to be profitably unemployed. I probably read more books and listened to more podcasts than I previously had in the rest of my life combined. I started tweeting and met some amazing people from around the world while discovering that being authentic on the internet could bring me great luck. Between some bonus time living at home with my family and many months spent in Airbnbs with Lauren, I got to live in South Carolina, New York, Tennessee, New Jersey, and Georgia, all for at least a month.\n\nIt has been an amazing 18 months, but I firmly believe this next chapter is going to be my best yet.\n\nI hope you will follow along at [x]. I believe it is going to be something special.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support. I feel so fortunate and grateful.\n\n\\- Jake"}]}

I am sure you would agree it would be good if you got a raise today and bad if you spilled a full cup of coffee on your shirt. Still, I will argue that in reality there is no such thing as good or bad.\n\nI learned this through experience using what I believe is reasonable logic. If you had asked me before I began my freshman year of college at The University of Richmond if I wanted to have a good time or a bad time, obviously, I would have chosen a good one. If you had asked me if I wanted to be mistakenly locked out of registering for classes during the freshman sign-up period (which was already after everyone else in the school), or if I wanted to spend my first semester as the only Jew in a \"Muslim Saints & Sinners\" class and the only guy in \"Women's Autobiographies\", I would have said of course not. I have much greater interests. If you had asked me if I wanted to have strep throat a few times and a chronic cough for the year and to realize later on that it was probably because my dorm room had some mold in it, I would have had to have been crazy to see that as a good thing right? But it was.\n\nYou see, I believe in the butterfly effect, or at least the possibility of it. The way I think about the butterfly effect is that even the smallest changes can have the largest impacts. The term was coined in the 1970s from \"the notion that a butterfly fluttering in Rio de Janeiro could change the weather in Chicago.\" I reference this phenomenon because it leads me to believe that any small changes in my life, if they had played out differently, could have changed absolutely everything in the path of my life thereafter, and I strongly believe that they would have.\n\nIn light of that, if I had not had such a lousy freshman year at Richmond, I never would have decided to leave and start my own company, never would have taken the gap year that more tangibly changed my life. I never would have gone to Vanderbilt and I never would have met many of the people I call my best friends today. I doubt I would have enjoyed a semester in Florence or spent a year and a half working in San Francisco. I might not have had the same appreciation then for New York when I had the opportunity to move back about a year ago. I wouldn't have met my girlfriend, Lauren, and I wouldn't have made this blog. In fact, I can confidently say that if I didn't get locked out of my freshman registration seven years ago, you would not be reading this right now. There is just no way that could be.\n\nThe point is, you can say everything is good and bad, or you can say everything is neither good nor bad, but the fact is that the effects of any and every event are far too impactful in totality for you to possibly observe and make an accurate judgement about the goodness or badness of any event. That is why I do not believe there is such a thing as good or bad.\n\nIn practicality, I do not live by this belief in my daily life. It is a bit too far from the way things are I think, and some people might take it the wrong way and stop making an effort to do good things, be a good person, and live a good life. I am certainly not advocating for that. Like everyone else, I still hope for things that I think would be good, and to avoid things I think would be bad. There are things that I think are amazing and things that I think are horrific that are happening every day all over the world in an unimaginable number of instances, but the times when I draw on this belief are the times when things seem bad in the moment, when it might help a little bit to know and really believe that seemingly bad things can have incredibly good consequences. With this approach, I get the best of both worlds. When things seem good, I enjoy them as such, but when things seem bad I recall my freshman year at Richmond to remember that the bad things can in the end be good, and that one day I might look back and say I wouldn't have had them any other way."}]}

It was about not counting down the days until weekends and vacations. This piece is the complement to that one. It is called Don’t dread the end.\n\nI have been away with my family this week in a northeast beach town where we have spent a week or two most summers since I was born. I noticed the other day that, unlike in years past, I am not so often thinking about how many days are left in the vacation. I used to do this all the time and feel like the week was going by so quickly. It was mostly a means of dreading the end. I do not think I need to explain in much detail the downside of dreading of the end. I will just say that any time spent dreading the end is not enjoyable, and if you are dreading what is after that time, you should probably be enjoying it while it lasts. \n\nI do not feel like I am dreading the end this time. It is not hard to understand why. \n\nLast year, I spent the day before we left on the beach, reading, swimming in the ocean, and enjoying time with my family under the sun. I spent the day after we left sitting in my cubicle in a dully lit office, working from 10 to 10, going home, going to sleep, waking up, and doing it again. \n\nThis year, I will again leave the beach and go back to work, but work now is what I choose it to be. I have two days of podcast recordings preceded by two days of prep. I will write. I will run. I will read. I will think. I may even work on my golf game. Some may call some of these things work. Others may not. I do not care what one calls them. The important part is that they are all things I care to do. \n\nI am not dreading the end of vacation this year because, as much as I am enjoying it, I am digging what I am doing outside of it as well. I know vacation would not be as special if it lasted longer so I am just enjoying it for what it is. It is what it is after all.\n\nRight now, I have reached a fine balance that, even while in it, I can appreciate is hard to reach and may be harder to maintain. It is the balance between counting down the days and dreading the end where I am definitively not doing either. I could even dread the end of having this balance itself. I could dread the day when I may find myself going for a job not because I want it but because doing something so different (not looking for work at 26) can sometimes feel harder than the common thing (having a job), even if the common thing requires 8 hours a day at a desk and the different thing allows me to do whatever I want whenever I want. I could dread that day and I could dread the end but why should I when I can simply let that thought pass as quickly as it came to mind? No counting down the days. No dread about the end.\n\nThis is one of my posts that reminds me I am writing for myself first and foremost. If I was writing for you, I might not be so positive. This might read phony to you, but I know it is true. I will be able to look back and read this and know that this balance is possible. I will know that I have been here before. I will know that I have lived in a state where, even if only for a short time, I have not counted the days, nor dreaded the end. I will know then that if I have done it once, I can do it again.\n\nWhen I wrote Don't count the days , I quoted Muhammad Ali. He said, \"Don't count the days. Make the days count.\" I will end this piece with an attempt at a complement to that quote.\n\n\"Don't dread the end. Just end the dread.\""}]}

This can be counterproductive, annoying, and slow things down.\n\nThe right way to push back is rarely, when it matters, and when the decision might be changed.\n\nThe wrong way to push back is often, when it doesn’t matter, and when the decision won’t be changed.\n\nI’ll address the 3 determining variables in a bit more detail:\n\n1\\. Rarely — If you push back too often, the power of your pushback will be diluted so that every individual pushback becomes weakened. This is why I use the term pushback budget. It’s useful to think of it as a relatively scarce budget with negative consequences for overspending. There’s plenty of budget to push back effectively every time it is most valuable to do so — but you do not have an unlimited budget to be spent recklessly. Spend wisely.\n\n2\\. When it matters — Of course, whether something matters is not a yes or no as much as it is somewhere on a spectrum, but you can roughly think of this in terms of Bezos’ Type 1 vs. Type 2 decisions — is it reversible? Big, irreversible decisions are orders of magnitude more important to get right than small reversible ones that don’t really matter. Yet you’d be surprised how commonly people push back and argue about the latter. This is a complete waste of one’s pushback budget. Save it for what matters — the irreversible and the important.\n\n3\\. When the decision might be changed — It is easy to see as an objective observer when an argument passes a point where there is no chance the decision-maker is going to change their mind. The person pushing back has already presented their primary points. The decision-maker often feels as or more strongly in their original stance as they did before the pushback. Even if they have conceded a bit, it is clear they are nowhere near changing their mind. The decision simply isn’t going to change, not until after it is made and the resulting information is produced at least (this takes time). Yet some people will continue to argue and push back here. This is also a waste of one’s pushback budget. It is usually counterproductive, annoying, and slows things down.\n\nThe worst is when someone pushes back often, on things that don’t matter, beyond the point where it is obvious to others that the decision is not going to change. It’s this kind of frequent, futile, and frustrating pushback that can get a person fired. It’s unproductive, unhelpful, and wasting everyone’s time. It’s useless revolt that only serves to slow everyone down. If you catch yourself doing this, stop.\n\nAll of that said, effectively pushing back on the right issue, in the right way, at the right time, is one of the most valuable soft skills a person can develop. In a company setting, it can be company-saving. In a hospital setting, it can be life-saving. So it’s important to work on pushing back the right way, and managing your pushback budget accordingly."}]}

The Bengals are 0-11 and yet today they will beat the Jets who just last week inspired a brief, rare, and always appreciated glimpse of hope after dominating a good Raiders team by a score of 34-3. Today's loss shows the epitome of being a fan of the New York Jets, Mets, and Knicks. Their tragic losses and inevitable disappointments are somehow as unbelievable as they are utterly unsurprising. \"Classic Jets (or Mets or Knicks)\", they say.\n\nThere is, however, a silver lining. I believe rooting for these teams builds character. All my life they have lost, but they keep playing, and I keep rooting for them. They fail and they fail and they fail, but they stick with it, and I strive to emulate that, failures included. I don't waste my time watching them as much as I used to, and that's a good thing too. After all, I do not aspire to be remembered as the best Jets, Mets, Knicks fan there ever was. I just want to have a Jets team to be excited about some Sundays, a Mets team to root for in October every few years, and a magically hot Knicks team to go see in the Garden. For all that we do not know about winning and championships, we know about finding hope where most would not, about failing, persisting, and always believing. One day, we will win it all.\n\nLastly, if today's Jets game was not so unbearable to watch, I may have never taken the action to begin this blog which was no more than an idea prior to the opening kickoff. So many ideas come and go without becoming anything more than that, and that is part of the reason why I have started this blog. If you like it, you can thank the Jets."}]}

Most human needs, in fact, we regularly satisfy without ever having the need to even think about them. Others may require minimal thinking but have become somewhat autonomous habits such as remembering to eat and drink. Because they are so easily satisfied, most people do not spend a lot of time thinking about human needs, because for the most part, we do not need to. But I am not most people.\n\nRecently, I have spent some time thinking about the fundamental human needs. I am more generally using my freedom of time at home to think about the things that I want to do, and I figured better than beginning with my wants, I should start with my needs. I know that they must all be reasonably satisfied given that I am continuing to live, but I thought it might be useful to ensure my needs are covered not only to a satisfactory level, but to an optimal one.\n\nThe best list of human needs which I have come across is laid out by Albert Wenger in his exceptional book titled, World After Capital. That is the list that I used in thinking about optimizing the satisfaction of my own human needs, and that is the list that I will be sharing with you today.\n\nFor the time being, I have accepted the eleven human needs to be oxygen, water, calories, nutrients, discharge, temperature, pressure, light, healing, learning, and meaning. There are a few common questions that I have responded to in discussing this list and I have included examples of those questions and answers as follows:\n\nQuestion 1: Aren't calories and nutrients basically the same thing? Do we really need both?\n\nAnswer 1: Calories and nutrients are not the same. Calories are \"the units of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 °C\" and nutrients are \"substances that provides nourishment essential for growth and the maintenance of life\", according to Google at least. We need both because if you got all of your nutrients in pills and powders but did not consume the minimum number of calories to survive you would eventually die of starvation. On the other hand, if you had plenty of calories but very poor nutrition you might end up like the British teenager who ate strictly chips and fries until he went blind. Malnutrition may not kill humans as quickly as starvation but sufficed to say it will catch up with us eventually and most people understand that. That is why we need both calories and nutrients.\n\nQuestion 2: What is discharge and why do we need it?\n\nAnswer 2: Discharge defines a category of human functions that includes exhaling carbon dioxide and both numbers one and two in the bathroom. Without those basic human functions, unless one believes certain claims about The Supreme Leader of North Korea, humans cannot survive.\n\nQuestion 3: Why do we need learning?\n\nAnswer 3: Without learning, we as individuals never would have figured out how to walk or talk. It is easy to see how someone who knew absolutely nothing would not be able to last very long in this world, and to know anything, we need to learn.\n\nAfter considering some of these needs on my own and responding to some of the questions above among others, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt as a working list of all human needs. I could not think of any others to add. Money, for example, we do not need so long as we have satisfactory food, water, basic healthcare to provide necessary healing, and shelter and/or sufficient clothing to allow our bodies to maintain a necessary range of temperature. If you have another idea, I encourage you to please send it to me in an email with your argument to jake@blogofjake.com.\n\nOnce I became satisfied with the list, I started to check off the ones that were more passively satisfied and either could not be further optimized or that I did not desire to further optimize. These included discharge, temperature, pressure, light, and healing. I figured I could try to dress more appropriately to the weather as I often find myself not doing, and I could probably do some more work to ensure I have access to the best healthcare providers available, but I figured if I got to a point where I needed the best healing, I would prioritize that, and if I dressed more appropriately, well maybe I would get a cold or two less every few years and save myself some temporary temperaturary discomfort, but these did not seem like very significant improvements, so I considered their respective categories to be passively optimized for now.\n\nThe remaining categories include oxygen, water, calories, nutrients, learning, and meaning. These, I believe, are more worthwhile to think about, but to varying degrees. Oxygen, for example, we clearly get enough of through passively breathing, otherwise we would die. That said, even though breathing is a mostly unconscious activity, I imagine it can be improved with consistent, conscious practice. Mediation and breathing exercises have a number of other purported benefits as well and so as a result of my analysis of needs I gained some further conviction in my belief that it is worthwhile for me to experiment with these types of practices to find one that works well for me. In doing so, I can improve my breathing on average, even if the vast majority of it remains unchanged, as I will at the very least be improving about 10 minute per day, about 5 days per week.\n\nI approached this list of needs with a goal in mind of picking the single priority need that I wanted to improve upon, and had I done this exercise four months ago, I believe that I would have chosen meaning. If we accept the assumption that meaning is a human need, we all must have enough of it to keep living, but there is a big difference between the minimal amount of meaning required to keep living and a greater level of meaning with which we can feel a deep sense of purpose as our status quo or our modus operandi or whatever you want to call the way we feel normally most of the time during most of our days. I believe that we all have some idea about what our purpose is and what gives us a sense of meaning but some of us have spent less time thinking about it, attempting to define it, and iterating upon it in comparison to others. I never had done any of that myself until several months ago when I came to find that my purpose, as best as I could define it, ended up being pretty close to a quote that I had already included at the bottom of my resume for a number of years before that. I somehow knew that this quote captured who I was enough to include it as the lone quote on my resume, but I would not have been able to connect it if you had asked me in a given moment to tell you what my purpose was, not before four months ago at least. Today I can, and I fully expect this purpose will be iterated upon and maybe even change completely over the course of my lifetime, but for now it goes something like this, \"to understand how the world works and what the future holds, to communicate that understanding through writing and conversation, and to invest my time and money in ways that will make the world a better place.\" Sure, it may sound somewhat idealistic, but yours probably will too. A greater sense of purpose and meaning is somewhat idealistic by definition, but since we need it as humans, we might as well find one that sounds best to us, rather than just going with whatever anyone else seems to be living for.\n\nIf I had done this same exercise in looking at this list of needs three months ago, I would likely have chosen calories & nutrition as the one that I most wanted to improve upon addressing. I have long believed that optimizing calories and nutrition could lead to a healthier life with a better probability of a longer one too. Up until three months ago, I had only experimented with a number of programs and strategies including periodically going gluten-free or gluten-light as well as several months in spurts of intermittent fasting, more often on weekdays than weekends. Three months ago I got lucky and sort of stumbled upon a few reasons in short sequence that made a vegan diet seem somewhat intriguing to me for the first time. As a result, in mid-January I started practicing a gluten-free vegan diet with intermittent fasting during the week (now Monday up until dinner on Friday) with extremely nutritious smoothies to break each fast and a freedom to eat absolutely whatever I want whenever I want from Friday dinner through Sunday night for the weekends, with the added flexibility to make exceptions once in a while during the week if I am going out to dinner which I typically try to limit to Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. This program has worked phenomenally well for me and I have no desire to change it as of now. It feels optimized for an excellent balance of health and happiness and it is one of the best fundamental changes I have made in recent memory. It has only been about 3 months now since I started, but I do not expect to be changing much in the way of my general approach to calories and nutrition anytime soon.\n\nAt this point, I have now covered oxygen, meaning, calories, and nutrition. For those who are following along, the two remaining needs on the non-passive side of the list are water and learning. Again, I am clearly satisfying both of these needs, but on both of them I do believe I could do significantly better and, of course, benefit from doing so. Learning is something that I am actively working on but in terms of progress I think I am closer to where I was a year ago with nutrition and calories than where I am now. I finally broke the dam of the podcast world this year and listening to them while running in particular is now one of my favorite things to do. I have also come to appreciate the value of Twitter while also coming to appreciate the negative value of too much of it. I have gradually figured out a few of my favorite newsletters and blogs and in terms of books I have been thinking about and experimenting with not only what I am reading but how I am reading it. I am considering what experiences I want to engage in to learn from, and I am learning a lot from writing too, but a system or set of guidelines for learning is something that I have yet to really develop. I am sure that I will write about it if and when I come up with something that works for me.\n\nFor now, the need that I am choosing to prioritize to improve upon is one of the most basic ones, water. Since I started running more this year I have had times when I get a bit light-headed after standing up. These times come and go but since I am large and relatively active I found that I probably would benefit from drinking 3 liters of water per day versus the less than 2 that I would guess that I normally drink on average. In order to improve my hydration, I have bought a 1 liter bottle and will drink a full one first thing in the morning as I have done sometimes in the past. I will then make sure to drink another two full liters through this bottle throughout the day, and I may even use the Streaks app to track it in the beginning until I become used to hydrating more just like I used the Zero app for fasting before I got used to that.\n\nMany of us spend so much time thinking about the endless lists of things that we want but very little time thinking about whether we can do more than simply satisfy the bear minimum requirements of our needs. My hope is that this may inspire some of you to spend an hour or so thinking about how your basic human needs are being addressed and whether one or two of them could be improved upon with a little planning and effort. I made my plan for now, and it should not be very difficult to change my steady state from dehydrated to properly hydrated.\n\nThis is how I think about needs. Next, I will be thinking about wants."}]}

It took me over 9,000 days to get here. In another hundred days, I expect to be in the best shape of my life still, but that best will be better than this one, and I intend for that trend to continue on for a while.\n\nI have never been in great shape before. I would hesitate to say that I have ever even been in good shape. In high school, I played basketball (starting only because our team was awful) and lacrosse (barely), but I only ever liked to play. I never really liked to train, and I never really did much of anything that I didn't like to do, so I never really did any sort of training at all. In sprints, suicides, and 17s (named for the number of times we had to run across the basketball court), I was always near the back of the pack. I was physically beat because I was mentally weak, not for a lack of will, I do not think, but rather, a lack of knowledge about, experience with, and belief in a number of ways by which I could systematically improve my steady state, ways in which I could grow and get better.\n\nWhen I was 19, I left the university I was at to start my own company. The venture failed, but the experience instilled in me a belief in the positive power of positivity, and in the rewards which are granted to those who dare to be different. My gap year made me realize that I could effectively improve myself as a person, and my three-year education in human and organizational development that followed helped train my brain to see the world from a perspective which would allow me to do just that.\n\nAfter graduation, I moved out to San Francisco to begin a job in investment banking. Journaling every morning was the first thing that I noticed helped me wire my brain in a positive way. I do the same thing today that I did then. Open a blank, lined page in a medium-sized notebook, write the date at the top, underline it, write a first sentence that says, \"Today is going to be an X day\", where X is some positive word like good, great, excellent, awesome, or extraordinary, and continue on to fill the page with sentences of intentional positivity and gratitude until I run out of room, often ending with a sentence about how lucky I am. If you write something as if you believe it over and over again, it does not very much matter whether you do or not, eventually, you will.\n\nI have written in previous posts about a number of other habits that I have introduced and/or practiced over the years, but today my intention is to write about running, and more specifically, reasons to run.\n\nWith that said, the following reasons are some of the many why I run, in no particular order. Maybe some of them will inspire you to do the same. I hope they do, but if nothing else, this will be a great reference for me to come back to if ever my conviction in running weakens, or if my belief in its merits become faded or forgotten.\n\nDiscipline - this must be one of the most important characteristics to develop. Fortunately, I believe it is in my blood from both parents, but that does not mean it did not have to be actively awakened and developed. For a while, I used to take cold showers every morning. That is a good way to learn about discipline. The first day it sucks. The next day it sucks. It continues to suck until one day you realize it doesn't suck that much anymore. Some days you might even enjoy it. Part of discipline to me is about doing things that you do not want to do over and over again until they are no longer painful or hard, until you no longer dread them, and until you can sometimes or even most of the time come to enjoy them. Discipline is also about much more than that. As much as discipline is about doing things we do not necessarily want to do, it may be more about not doing things that we want to do but which we know are not good. It takes discipline for many people to cut back on drinking, smoking, binge eating, binge movie-watching, or binge anything you are tempted to binge. More than only doing and not doing, discipline is about a third thing as well. Discipline can be exhibited in the way we do things, demonstrated by how we do them. Running five times per week as I have hit my literal and figurative stride over the last couple of months has helped me become more disciplined in all three of these ways. The first is by just doing it. Some days my runs are enjoyable but many days they are not. I do them for all of the reasons I am writing about but none of them are explicitly about enjoyment. Running keeps me disciplined to do things daily that I believe in but do not necessarily want to do. The second and third ways in which running has made me more disciplined, these ones related to the not doing and the way we do things, are drawn from a beautiful quote that I often am reminded of from my friend Eric. Eric, more than anyone, deserves credit for convincing me on the merits of running and kickstarting my training which has persisted to this day. That began back when we were traveling around Japan for a few weeks last fall, by train and by foot. During a run one day, he told me something like this, \"we must have the ambition to go fast, but the discipline to go slow\". From this, it becomes obvious that the thing to be disciplined enough not to do while running is to go too fast and that the disciplined way to do it is to go slow. It feels nice to run a mile or two and improve upon your time by pushing harder and harder and harder, but these quick hits of dopamine released by the satisfaction of speed-related achievements do not last long. They are fleeting, like all things, and they will not allow you to experience many of the other benefits of running and the reasons to run that I am about to continue on writing about.\n\nPatience - closely intertwined with the prior reason to run, patience is a virtue that both requires discipline and is required to build it. Running far, slowly, is less about testing your lungs or your legs than it is about testing your mind. I once had Siri take a note in a moment of clarity while I was on a run. It said, \"Running is all about pain. Pace takes threshold. Distance takes tolerance.\" To run far, one must learn to tolerate and eventually accept the uncomfortable state of running in which breathing is more difficult and the body is constantly working. We must normalize the feeling of hitting the ground over and over again through the impact of one foot which, without any chance against the relentless force of gravity, must will itself anyway to push one's body weight off of the ground and forward once more. \"Onwards and upwards\", as Eric and I said. In a world in which Ivy League educated psychologists are employed by media and social media companies to help guide developers on how best to program computers to automatically gain and keep our attention, it is more essential than ever, I would argue, to develop patience. It is crucial to build the ability to keep one's attention on something chosen, something good, and to stick with whatever that might be without any immediate expectations of a return, or a dopamine hit, or a like. Just a number of months ago, I used to become impatient running on a treadmill for a single mile or two. Three miles was daunting and seriously tested my patience. Now I run outside, and that helps, and in the last couple of months I have never run less than three miles, and I have developed the patience to keep running for an hour or even two or more for the longer runs, and I hope to go longer than that.\n\nNature - this is the critical element that in combination with building patience has helped me to run longer. Most people do not spend a lot of time in nature. We mostly see it outside of home and office windows, through car windshields, or on TV. We literally sit inside and put outside on a screen. Most agree that seeing nature pales in comparison with experiencing it, and running presents a great opportunity to do just that. Another friend I credit largely for giving me the inspiration to start running regularly in the first place is my buddy Jack, alongside whom I survived my first year of investment banking out in San Francisco. I asked him for a quote to include with my post today and he sent me 100 words that he wrote on the theme of \"blue skies\" for a ritual in which his dad, his brother and him are writing 100 words a day with a given theme. Here is what Jack wrote about blue skies, \"Blue skies beckon me to the streets, like swells call a surfer or lamps summon a bug, for a rare mid-day run. Past equestrian statues and up hills, across storied bridges where Taft strode and towards streams where Teddy stripped, supposedly, I descend into Rock Creek, the wooded oasis where Georgetown and Kalorama converge like summer and winter collapse into spring. Thoughts of work release from the kink in my neck, rising like steam before fizzling in a poof or dripping in a bead of sweat. So it seems, for blue skies I have come, and blue skies I've become.\" Some days, I question whether my writing is any good at all. After reading this passage from Jack, this became one of those days. Nonetheless, running enhances my connection with nature, and Jack's, it would seem, even more so.\n\nMeditation - going back to Jack's quote, it is not all about nature. I love his line about thoughts of work releasing from the kink in his neck, rising like steam before fizzling in a poof or dripping in a bead of sweat. I texted him back, \"To me it sounds like a meditation of sorts, without taking on the baggage that that can take, it is about witnessing thoughts and letting them pass, rising and falling as you say.\" He texted me back, \"Exactly. You get it entirely.\" We are on the same page because we share similar perspectives I am sure, but more than anything, because we run. We know what it is like to notice thoughts come and go over the course of hours in which we are running in perpetual motion. We understand what it feels like to have our bodies run with our minds still, a welcomed change from having our minds run with our bodies still. Running can be a meditation of sorts, especially, I have found, without headphones giving me audio to focus on.\n\nPodcasts - although running without headphones, in my opinion, can be the most meditative, over the last couple of months, I most often have listened to podcasts while running. Earlier this week, I wrote about how I have committed to the practice of smoga because it combines three things I think would be worth my time into one thing that I know must be worth it. Beyond the fact that I have really come to enjoy listening to podcasts while running, I do it because it takes two things I think would be worth my time and turns them into one thing that I know must be worth it. I listen to podcasts mostly as a means of learning, and a very enjoyable means at that, and I figure if I can spend an hour or so most days running while learning, well, that is not going to be an hour of that day that I regret. I never got into running as much until I got into podcasting and I never got into podcasting as much until I got into running.\n\nGrowth - in the introduction of this post, I wrote about how I developed a desire to develop myself. This concept can best be described as a growth mindset. Having committed to a growth mindset years ago before I even had the term to describe it, I do not feel very well if I start feeling stagnant for too long, or like I am becoming complacent with the way that things are or the way that I am, or worse than any of that, like I am actually getting worse. That feels as though I am wasting the amazing opportunity unlike any other, that is, the opportunity of life. I understand that one day my mind and my body may begin to decline in a way that is at least in some part outside of my control, but for now I am 25-years-old, and anything I have done to date is nothing in comparison to my potential. I must grow into that potential slowly and over time, and running helps me to maintain that growth mindset, as well as the patience and discipline to grow slow. I know that the longer I do anything, the further I can go. The longer I keep running, the further I can go, and over time, running slow becomes less and less slow, until it is fast, but still feels slow. Grow to run and one will run to grow. That is the way that it has worked for me at least.\n\nThere are many other reasons to run, some that I not have not yet discovered and other that I have but am forgetting. One can run so that one may learn that life is not a race, so that one may experience the saying that \"it is a marathon and not a sprint\", so that one can feel true hunger and true thirst and the satisfaction of relieving them, so that one can become grateful, so that one can feel good. Running has made me healthier and for all the above reasons and more which describe why I do it, running, in and of itself, is one of the biggest reasons why I am in the best physical, mental, and overall shape of my life. With great discipline, patience, hunger, and health, among many other gifts for which I am grateful, I will continue to run, and I will continue to grow."}]}

The last time I read it was during my gap year in 2013/2014 when I was working on starting a company of my own. It was one of the first books I read cover to cover and it was immeasureably impactful on my perspective at the time. In many ways, it continues to inform how I think about life today. This book is not nearly as well-known as the official biography by Walter Isaacson, which I read as well, but I enjoyed this book more and found it to be more valuable to me personally. The organization and structure of the book is based upon Steve Job's Stanford Commencement Speech, which I have written about previously.\n\nI often recall quotes from that speech such as \"you cannot connect the dots looking forward\", \"you have to trust in something; your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well worn path\", and \"remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.”\n\nBelow is a list of quotes from the book that I underlined in my recent reading. Perhaps one of them you will find to be worthy of an underline as well.\n\n8 - \"Well, my greatest reward I think is... I've been able to build this wonderful organization...

The snippet of a speech that I am sharing with you today qualifies as that for me.\n\nThe first 75 seconds are interesting and the last 23 are credits. In between, there is a 2 minute segment that I find hard to forget. The speaker, Alan Watts, proposes a possibility I had never considered. He suggests that if we could dream any life we wanted to dream, and if we could do that over and over again, eventually, we would choose to dream the lives we are living. After dreaming lives of consistent pleasure and total pre-determination, we would choose to dream a life in which we did not have control. We would choose to dream a life of constant surprises.\n\nI like this idea. It makes me question decisions I consider that might make my life more predictable. It makes me want to do things that are different and things that are new. It makes me want to be adventurous and always open to surprises.\n\nThis is the dream of life. Listen to Alan Watts explain it.\n\n[URL]"}]}

Most of the rest of the country followed suit.\n\nUtah Jazz Center Rudy Gobert went from making a mockery of COVID-19 to testing positive for it two days later, and then his teammate tested positive too, and then a player from a team that they played, and then several more players from several other teams. It is interesting now to read this two tweet thread that I shared on March 17th where I used the number of NBA players who had tested positive at that time to show why the 5,000 or so cases we had confirmed in the USA at that point was definitively off by at least a zero or two. I wrote...\n\n\"450 players in NBA, 7 now tested positive. Just over 1.5% of the league, which seems to be testing as quickly and broadly as we would have hoped our nation could. If 1.5% of US has coronavirus that means over 5 million people. Doubt that is the case but... It seems insane that we have only confirmed 5K thus far. I am glad that organizations and govs took the social distancing measures they did as early as they did in terms of the confirmed case count. True case count must be 10x or more likely closer to 100x or more (50K-500K+)... \"\n\nBecause the NBA acted relatively early, a reasonably low percentage of all players in the NBA got the virus. Had they acted much later, the virus would have spread exponentially and wreaked much more havoc around the league.\n\nThe NBA also set the example in terms of mass testing. Granted, it is much easier for them to do than for a whole country, and one can question how they got access to so many tests and accuse them of taking tests from the rest of the population if they want, but that is a separate argument that I am not interested in addressing. Regardless of that raiseable controversy, the fact of the matter is that the NBA successfully executed testing broadly, quickly, and early, and the USA as a country is still working on following its lead in that regard. Still, we are hardly out of the gates in relative terms with only 0.63% of the population tested and about 19% of them or 0.12% of the population having tested positive. Through proactive testing, the NBA learned quickly that most of its players with the virus were almost, if not totally, asymptomatic. I believe the USA and the world will eventually come to the same conclusion as testing eventually catches up to the prevalence of the virus, but we still have a ways to go.\n\nSimilar to closures, case counts, and testing, I believe the NBA will also lead the country in figuring out how to re-open itself to some degree in a way that is creative and increasingly effective as it innovates and adapts in ways which no one would have ever considered as recently as just a few months ago. The NBA will change the way it works for the foreseeable future, and then the USA will change the way it works for the foreseeable future too.\n\nBeyond closures, case counts, testing, and re-opening, there is also the economic fallout that will become apparent in parallel to the re-opening efforts, not in terms of markets (although that too), but in terms of actual people struggling. The Portland Trail Blazers' CJ McCollum just estimated that a third of the NBA lives paycheck to paycheck. A MarketWatch article from January suggests that up to 75% of Americans might too, and their paychecks on average are about 80 times smaller than the median NBA player's. Regardless of the exact figure, which is difficult to know for sure, here is something that I do know. In April, more Americans will collect $0 in total income than last month (excluding severance & unemployment benefits), and likely more than in any previous month since 1942 (9.9%). For those like me who are not the sharpest with history and dates, 1942 was the year of Pearl Harbor which precipitated the USA's entry into World War II about a decade removed from the beginning of the Great Depression. Unfortunately, May will be worse than April. June, I presume, will be worse than May. Most are predicting that the USA will see the worst of the virus, or the worst of this initial wave at least, at some point this month, but I do not know when we will see the worst of unemployment in America. I do not think it will be very soon, but probably sometime this year. Worst of all, the unemployment rate is poised to take many times longer to fall than it will to have risen, and that could mean years of potential recovery.\n\nAs an aside, The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics only started measuring the unemployment rate in 1929 when the market crashed to begin The Great Depression. I would not be surprised if some other rate begins to be measured to track our emergence back from the bottom this time around. We may now have better solutions to help people who cannot afford the essentials to get them compared with nearly a century ago when the single best way to help people recover was to get them jobs.\n\nFor all of the aforementioned reasons and more, I believe that the USA would be wise to pay some attention to the NBA, how it continues to be effected by the virus, and how it continues to respond to it. Of course, running a country or even a state is many degrees of magnitude more complex, at a scale that is many degrees of magnitude larger. That said, its leader has been ahead of the curve, both literally and figuratively, and I believe some helpful themes, realities, and/or strategies may be discovered in paying attention to how the situation with the NBA continues to unfold. In many ways, what happens with the NBA may be continue to be predictive of what happens with the USA."}]}

They are moving at the same exact speed. The only difference is that one of them got a 10-second headstart. That person has the advantage of being ahead the entire race, even though they are doing the exact same thing, moving at the exact same speed. They are always winning while the other person is always losing. Now imagine that race is not a simple sprint or even a marathon, but a race as long as life. This illustrates the unthinkable advantage of getting ahead. It is no harder for the person with the headstart to maintain their lead than it is for the person losing the entire way to maintain the distance they trail behind. In fact, it may in some cases be easier to stay ahead.\n\nAnother way to help illustrate this point is to look at the difference between savings and debt. Imagine two people both earn the same breakeven income to cover their same costs of living. The only difference is that one person starts with a little bit of savings and the other person starts with a little bit of debt. This small initial difference in their wealth will not only remain over time — it will actually grow much larger. The first person’s savings work for them, earning them interest over time. The second person’s debt works against them, charging them interest over time. Keep in mind, they are both earning the same income to cover the same costs of living the entire time. In this case, it is significantly easier for the person with the headstart to maintain their advantage than it is for the other person to maintain the amount by which they trail behind. Even if they both do the exact same thing over the long haul, the advantage granted by the initial headstart only increases over time.\n\nThis phenomenon applies in a number of other areas as well. Instead of thinking of it as the difference in a competition between two people, one can also think of it as the difference between two possible versions of oneself.\n\nFor example, one can lose the weight they want to lose in a relatively short period of time and then maintain a lower weight for years with no more effort than they would have needed to maintain their old heavier weight over time. All else equal, that person can enjoy the benefit of being in better shape for the rest of their life all because they put in some extra work for a short time to get down to their target weight just once.\n\nThis is the value of catching up and getting ahead. An early advantage can offer a lead for life. By putting in the short-term work in various areas to catch up and then get ahead, one can stay ahead in all of these areas without any more long-term effort in each, and often with less. This allows them to move on to catching up and getting ahead in other areas. The virtuous cycle continues.\n\nHumans seem hardwired to always be behind. In school, kids do not do all of their assignments a week before they are due. They do them all the night before they are due. Most people tend to focus on not getting too far behind rather than on catching up and getting ahead. They fail to realize that it would often take the same or less effort to maintain a lead as it does the deficit.\n\nCatching up and getting ahead is not necessarily easy, but once it is done, it is just as easy to stay ahead as it would have been to stay where one started. Catching up and getting ahead of wherever one is at the moment takes less time than that over which the benefits of doing so may be enjoyed. Get some leads in life. It is no harder and often easier to stay ahead than it is to stay behind. Why keep losing when you could just as easily keep winning? Catch up. Get ahead."}]}

The fundamental problem is that more and more people are working remotely and yet there is no ideal workplace designed for them to work.\n\nWeWork generated more than $40 billion worth of hype because the problem it sought to solve is very real and the market opportunity for those who solve it is accordingly massive. Their business model, however, proved to be unsustainable and the financial world now views WeWork was a colossal failure having lost roughly 90% of its value in a matter of months.\n\nFrom a consumer perspective, WeWork and similar solutions may still seem relatively popular as a result of all the early hype and unwarranted buzz, but the reality is that last year only 8% of remote workers identified coworking spaces (WeWork et al.) as their primary location for work. An even lesser 4% of them said that they work primarily from coffee shops. A whopping 83% on the other hand said that they primarily work from home.\n\nClearly, working from home is the most popular option for remote workers, but the four most popular struggles that remote workers report are unplugging after work, loneliness, collaboration, and distractions at home. Some of these struggles I have experienced myself in only a few weeks of primarily working at home. Today I made a plan with my buddy Harry to meet up and work separately but together for the afternoon. Harry is a good example of the increasingly popular employee who works mostly in an office but many days remotely, and always or almost always from home. In the bustling East Village of Manhattan, in the city with more than twice the number of coffee shops as any other city in the country, we could hardly find a workable one.\n\nFirst, I went to abraco, an awesome looking spot that I had passed by and wanted to try but which, after ordering a cappuccino, I realized had a no laptops policy which I totally respect and in fact think makes it a better cafe, but which also was a non-starter in considering it as an option for Harry and I to sit down and work for a few hours on our respective laptops. After a focused cappuccino undistracted by the typical primary attention grabbers of technology, I tried Saltwater Coffee, which had only a few seats, half of which were at a pretty crammed and unworkable high-top window-facing counter, and all of which were already occupied. Next I went to Third Rail Coffee. Two people were walking out as I walked in but someone new had already taken their seat... 0 for 3. My final failure was at Mud Spot which served me a remarkable Sunday brunch experience that I wrote about in this post a couple of Mondays ago, but which I found out today does not have WiFi. Four failures and an hour or so after I set out to find a satisfactory place for my friend Harry and I to work, I finally found one in 787 coffee, a recently opened coffee shop that was the first in the area to satisfy the bare minimum of having open seats, WiFi, and no anti-laptop rule. Even still, we had to leave after a couple of hours because it did not have a working bathroom. That is how hard it was to find a place to work with a friend in New York City without having to pay between $370 and $760 per person per month to gain minimum cost access to a local WeWork.\n\nIn summary, WeWork is too expensive for workers and not expensive enough to be near profitable. Coffee shops, as evidenced by my not atypical experience today, simply do not work. Coffee shops are great for the purpose that they serve, but they were not designed for the future of work in which more and more people will be working remotely more and more of the time. More than 8 in 10 remote workers are working remotely mostly from home, maybe because it is the best option they have, or more likely because it is the only option that they have. These people are often lonely and they struggle to unplug after work or to collaborate with others or to avoid distractions at home. There must be a better solution for this large and growing population of people and I am pretty sure I have it, but I am not going to write about it just yet."}]}

I beat the sun by a solid 45 minutes and watched it rise from the highest point of Masada.\n\nMasada is an ancient fortress where a group of Jews made their last stand against the over-powered Roman Empire in the year 74 CE. After the Romans had their Jewish prisoners build a ramp up to the top of Masada (so the Jews would not kill them while they built the ramp), the Jews holding the fortress knew that they stood no chance. They decided they would rather die than live as slaves. The general instructed the men to say their final goodbyes to their families and to kill them, which they did. Since murder was forgivable (you could still go to heaven) but suicide was not, the men that remained drew rocks to determine who would be the one to commit suicide, which they did as well. Today, Masada is where IDF soldiers are sworn in after completing their basic training. The importance of never again losing control of the Jewish state is reinforced as the ceremony ends with the declaration that “Masada shall not fall again.”\n\nWe rinsed off our sweat from the hike with the salty water of the Dead Sea, entering the water from the lowest point on earth. It is 3x as salty as the ocean and you do not want to put your head under water or walk with bare feet on the salt rocks of the sea floor. The Dead Sea is no longer one whole body of water as it continues to evaporate, creating land bridges between Israel and Jordan. It is a unique experience to lean back in the water and float so easily, and the mountainous desert surrounding the sea makes it a beautiful place to be.\n\nWe closed the day with a drive through part of the West Bank where we technically exited Israel for Palestine before re-entering Israel just outside of Jerusalem. Most everything was closing for Shabbat around 3pm at the time we arrived in Jerusalem. The last few days of our trip will be spent here."}]}

For a month or so, it decreased my screen time substantially. After that, I de-prioritized limiting my screen time and as with all things we do not prioritize, it became a casualty of my other decisions and priorities. I do not always follow my own advice and it does not always work even when I do. In this case, mostly following it did work for a bit, but then I stopped caring about the issue and so it naturally returned. \n\nAfter watching The Social Dilemma on Netflix last night on my brother’s recommendation, I care about the issue of screen time again. I am spending way more time on my phone than I believe is good for me. The most staggering statistics from the film demonstrating the ill effects of our addictions to social media (on our phones specifically) came from two charts. They showed the disturbing trends that have been observed among young girls since social media became popular on mobile phones around 2009. The number of teenage girls who ended up in a hospital because they cut themselves or otherwise harmed themselves was mostly steady for the first decade of the current millennium. Since 2009, it up 62% for 15-19 year olds (increased from 4 to 6 girls per 1,000) and 189% for 10-14 year-olds (increased from 1 to 4 girls in 1,000). Suicide rates among teen and pre-teen girls have followed a strikingly similar trend. These patterns seem poised to get worse as the algorithms of social media companies and other ad-based businesses get better and better at attracting our attention through “tools” designed more like slot machines than bicycles. In the documentary, there was a quote that said, “If you don’t pay for the product, you are the product.” There was another about how the only two kinds of businesses that call their customers users are app-makers and drug-dealers. The point is clear. Us users are not the customers. The ad-buyers are the customers. Our attention is the product. It is what the ad-buyers are paying for. The computers that control your feed are incentivized to increase the supply of the product, your attention. The more data you give them and the more advanced they get, the more of your attention they will take.\n\nSufficed to say, the documentary served as a good kicker to get me to do something I have been wanting to do but putting off for some time now, to spend less time on my phone. While the execution may be difficult, the plan should be relatively easy to create. I am almost done with it and am writing this now as a way of forcing myself to finish. \n\nI started by diagnosing the problem. I have been spending roughly 6-8 hours on my phone daily most weeks during the last couple of months. I am not proud of that figure. Roughly one-third of my screen time is spent on Twitter. Another half is split between Safari (internet), Messages (text), and Superhuman (email). I will make a note here that Safari would be the most helpful app for me to be able to break down further into what website I spend time on so if you know some way to do that please let me know. Anyway, that leaves just one-sixth of my screen time outside of those four applications. That is a huge positive from my perspective as the problem becomes much more manageable right away. I do not have to figure out much. I simply need to limit my time on Twitter a lot and on the internet, text, and email a bit. I will discuss my design of rules to help accomplish this solution before my design of my phone itself because the second part I did last night and am very happy with but the first part I still need to figure out... so here it goes.\n\nHere is the experiment I am going to commit to. I will only allow myself to use Twitter on my phone if it is directly after a meal and if I am walking. I learned from Josh Clemente on my podcast a few weeks ago that one of the best things people can do for their metabolic health is walk after meals. I can pair my dopamine-filled Twitter indulgence with this good habit and make it a great use of time overall (I do believe I get significant value from Twitter by learning from the select few people I follow, discovering others for the podcast, and more, but the issue is simply that I spend more time than is good for me). I will allow myself to make these Twitter walks as long as I want so long as my Twitter usage remain confined within the single walking session. Once I am done walking, no more Twitter until after my next meal if I want to walk again. I only eat around noon and dinner so there will be a maximum of two sessions on any day. Among other benefits, this will also keep me from starting or ending my day on Twitter which are the worst times to be on it or use a phone generally. I can try replacing it with reading which offers the same benefit (learning) but through a better habit. I will see how this goes... Importantly, I will also allow myself to go on Twitter on my computer whenever I want without limit. This may create a separate problem but I am okay with that if it solves the problem I am focused on solving which is to lower my phone screen time and, in order to do that, my time on Twitter on my phone specifically. I can access my phone anywhere at any time whereas my computer is dependent on WiFi and generally not as addicting for me. I sincerely doubt that it will become as big an issue, if it becomes one at all. Most importantly, being able to use Twitter on my computer allows me to avoid making reasonably valid excuses to go on Twitter on my phone, such as to tag and thank a podcast guest on the automatically tweeted links to the episodes that post when I publish them on podofjake.com . If I need to use Twitter, I can always use my computer.\n\nI believe the more simple and easy a strategy is, the more likely it is to be executed. For that reason, I will not make any further rules like the one I made for Twitter above. To recap, the rule is that I can only use Twitter on my phone while walking after a meal. I covered some of the nuances of what I can and cannot do but ultimately it is as simple as that. It is one rule and extremely easy to remember. We will see how it works.\n\nNext, I want to share with you my new phone design. I believe it will help me adhere to my Twitter rule and satisfactorily solve the remaining components of my overall phone time problem without my having to make any additional rules. Below you will see screenshots from my phone. The first is the screen when I unlock my phone and swipe from left to right. Next is my home screen. After that is my second screen, then the third screen, etc.. I will explain some of my reasoning for the design in the captions. Lastly, there are two general items I should note that are not captured by the screenshots. First, remember that although these screenshots are in color what I actually see on my phone is set to greyscale. This is something I have stuck with for over a year now and have high conviction is worthwhile. Second, I have turned off notifications on almost every app. This is also something I have had active for a while, though I did make a few new adjustments. The only apps with any notifications on are Calendar, Duo, Find My, GroupMe, Messages, Phone, Superhuman, Uber, Venmo, and WhatsApp. Moreover, the only ones with both banners and badges turned on are Messages and Superhuman (texts and emails).\n\nWithout any further ado, here is my phone from screen to screen:\n\nI like having my pedometer and weather app one swipe away from my home screen. Both are good to keep an eye on. Those 18 steps were from my bed to my bathroom to my desk -- more movement to come haha.\n\nTop: I really like this new widget feature on iOS 14. My screen time is now the first thing I see when I unlock my phone so it is impossible not to be conscious of it. The calendar only shows the next thing coming, encouraging me to take my days one thing at a time and more generally to take life one day at a time. /// Bottom: Podcasts, RunKeeper, 7, and Notes are all apps that I use or at least want to use near daily. RunKeeper tracks my runs and 7 gives me guided 7-minute HIIT workouts. They help me exercise. Podcasts and Notes are great.\n\nBasic tools. At this point, I have gone one swipe away in both directions from my home screen and there has still been nothing I am prone to over-using. From these first screens I can tell the time, check the weather, see my calendar, listen to a podcast, exercise, take a note, take a picture, use GPS, and set an alarm or timer. These are true and fundamental tools. I can use them whenever I want and they will never use me.\n\nNow things get a little crowded. Anything in the Listen category is fair game. Money I rarely use and GHIN even more rarely (only after a round of golf). The Communicate section is the important one on this page. It contains two of my top four apps where I spend the most screen time, Messages and Superhuman. By moving them a couple screens away from my home screen, I have added some friction to decrease my usage. I am fine with using both when I have a message to send or respond to, but I hope this move prevents me from other actions such as compulsively checking Superhuman to see if the recipient has opened my email yet (a useful feature, but an addicting one).\n\nI have added even more friction to get to Safari. After Twitter, Safari is where I would most like to decrease my time. I will not make any rules for it at this point, but I have made it harder to get to and titled the category \"Why?\" to encourage asking myself why I want to use Safari at the moment. If I am looking for something specific on the internet, I can use it, no problem. Most of the time, my guess is I am not. I usually bounce between websites that I don't gain much if anything from. The other apps in that section I do not use much as is but are prone to compulsive checking and the other sections on this screen I do not use an app from hardly ever.\n\nFinally, deep on the 5th screen of my phone we have Twitter. Again, the category is named to remind me of the circumstances under which I should enter, only if I am walking after a meal. I put the Pedometer app in there just so that I could make the category with that title. I never need to open this app as I can see my activity and open the app if I want from my widget in the first screenshot.\n\nThat is my plan to fix my phone addiction. I am looking forward to seeing how it works for me."}]}

As usual, we got two pizzas. This time, it was one plain and one margherita, both with sausage and meatballs on half. It was like a pizza venn diagram, and it was delicious. It has been more than 3 months now since I started practicing my gluten-free vegan diet with intermittent fasting during the week. The weekend freedom permitted by the program is as enjoyable as it is to feel good and clear-headed and healthy during the week. Since the beginning of our pizza night tradition, I am probably averaging four slices on Saturday nights with another one cold the next morning. This weekend, it was four at night and two in the morning.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nChanging it up a bit from my typical posts on The Weekend Miscellaneous , today I will be proposing an answer to a specific question.\n\nDoes cannabis consumption in moderation make people lazy?\n\nI believe the answer is no. You probably want to know why I believe that. Let me tell you.\n\nYesterday, I consumed 8 milligrams worth of THC and proceeded to run a half marathon (13.1 miles). That is the furthest I have run in my life. My pace was faster than when I ran a 19K (11.8 miles) two Sundays prior to raise awareness for our COVID-19K Feeding America fundraiser which has so far raised over $2,000 equating to more than 20,000 meals according to Feeding America.\n\nMy experience yesterday leads me to believe with a high level of conviction that, specifically, cannabis consumption in moderation does not make me physically lazy or mentally weak, not within a few hours following consumption at least.\n\nI specify this more narrow conclusion in response to the broader question I am addressing so as not to over-generalize my personal and purely experiential findings. I am well aware that cannabis consumption may affect different people in different ways, that consuming a greater amount of it or the same amount with greater frequency may alter its effects, and that it may have less easily observable impacts on people in the long-term, among many other considerations.\n\nThat said, it bears repeating that I have observed for myself that the infrequent use of cannabis in moderation definitively does not make me lazy as a result, neither mentally nor physically. Instead, it seems reasonable to suggest that it may in fact make me more active in both regards.\n\nWhile some people use cannabis to help them sleep, I have found that it makes me mentally active, imaginative, open-minded and free-thinking. I had some of my best and clearest ideas in a while during my run yesterday and I can now both refine and build upon them with a sober mind. Basically, I have found that infrequent cannabis consumption in moderation makes me the opposite of lazy. It makes me active.\n\nThen again, just because something seems positive in the short-term does not mean it is a good idea. As a college kid curious about the long-term effects of cannabis consumption, I once did a literary review of the science on the subject as a part of my favorite class that I took in college. The class was called Systematic Inquiry and it was all about how we know what we know. I would like to share that paper for those who are interested but it is on my old laptop which I did not bring home with me from my apartment in New York. I hope to share it another time. The biggest takeaway was that the scientific work that has been conducted on the subject to date leaves a lot to be desired, and although it did not convince me of any significantly adverse effects in the long-term, I err on the side of caution because so much remains unstudied and unknown.\n\nI realize that this post is timely as I was reminded that today is 4/20, cannabis culture's biggest holiday. I myself will not be celebrating. I had a little bit yesterday and I have come to believe in the benefits of being totally sober almost all of the time, having drugs even as widely accepted as caffeine, alcohol, and to a lesser extent, cannabis, only infrequently and mostly in moderation.\n\nMany things in life are bad to have in excess but totally fine and enjoyable to enjoy responsibly. I enjoy enjoying those things that way."}]}

So what exactly does that mean?\n\nWell, the second part “let people get it where they go” is similar to the common advice to “meet customers where they are.” Meeting customers where they are is about appealing to them in the places where they are already spending their time online, though it applies offline in the physical world as well. You’re not trying to get them to go to a new place. You’re simply meeting them where they are. I’m aligned with this strategy, mostly.\n\nBut if you change the word “customers” to “people”, the saying “meet people where they are” is understood to have a different meaning. Meeting people where they are is about compromise. It’s not about meeting people where they are in a literal sense in terms of the digital place or website or channel where they already spend some time. It’s about meeting them where they are in terms of their tastes and preferences and desires. This, I am not aligned with.\n\nThat’s where the first part of my first sentence comes in — “create what you want”. That’s what I want to do — to create what I want. That might seem obvious, that I want to do what I want. But a lot of people actually don’t do what they want. Why not? Because they prioritize their want to do what the customer wants. They want to meet people where they are. I want to create what I want and let people get it where they go. There’s a difference. It seems like a nuanced difference, but it’s not. It changes everything you do because you are doing it unapologetically for you, not for some customer, imaginary or otherwise.\n\nThis difference in approaches changes both what you do and how you do it. That makes sense because it all stems from this fundamental difference in why you’re doing it — for you, because it’s what you want to do. For me, I like blogging and podcasting, to a lesser degree tweeting, and more recently have been making some digital art. With all of these things, I do what I want. I write about whatever I want. I don’t restrain myself to a particular subject or niche that I recognize could more effectively build an audience. The same is true for podcasting — no niche. I just talk to whoever I want about whatever I want. I also produce the podcast the way that I want. That means minimal editing, post-production, marketing, and all that. I tweet what I want and I make the digital art that I want. And I do all of this pseudonymously, even though I know I would probably have a larger following if I showed my face and shared my name. Both build trust and likability, but pseudonymity is my preferred approach for operating on the internet. So that’s the general overview on what I do and how I do it. Now how about where I share it?\n\nFor a long time, I posted my blogs on a Wordpress website, my podcasts on Apple and Spotify, and I tweeted on Twitter, as one does. More recently, I’ve made an effort to meet people where they are practically, but not preferentially — to “let people get it where they go” but not to “meet people where they are”, if you can recall the difference as I described it. Logistically, this means I am sharing my blogs, podcasts, tweets, and digital art on multiple platforms, which is normal in some contexts, but unusual in others. For example, it is normal to publish podcasts across Apple, Spotify, YouTube, and more, and I publish mine there as well as elsewhere and on my podcast website. It is less usual to publish blogs in multiple places, but that is what I have started to do in an effort to let people read my writing wherever they go, wherever they are, wherever they like. \n\nFor years, I resisted moving from my Wordpress website to Substack because I felt Substack was for newsletters and what I write is not a newsletter. But this stubbornness, while grounded in fact, was preventing people from being able to serendipitously stumble upon my writing, as the internet is inclined to enable. Substacks are much more easily discoverable than Wordpress websites because people who like to read people’s writing are already on Substack where Wordpress does not have a comparable network effect. So I switched to Substack earlier this year, but not to Substack only. Now, when I write, I publish on Substack and Paragraph, a Substack-like website for people interested in crypto and web3. On Substack, supporters can choose to do a paid subscription to support my work (though everything I write is available to free subscribers all the same). On Paragraph, supporters can collect my blog posts by minting them onchain (for crypto people). They can do that for free except for the platform fee of .000777 ETH (~$2.71). A little less than half of that goes to me. In addition to Substack and Paragraph, I sometimes take a screenshot of the full blog post and publish it on Twitter and/or Warpcast as a “screenshot essay”. I’ll also share the Paragraph post on Warpcast as what I call an “inframe onchain essay” or “IOE” (don’t worry if you have no idea what I’m talking about here). For those who don't know Warpcast, it is roughly a Twitter-like social network for crypto people with crypto elements involved. I generally try to cross-post my tweets there as casts and vice versa, except for when the content of the tweet or cast is less relevant on the other platform, which has increasingly become the case for some of the more crypto-native content I have been posting on Warpcast.\n\nLastly, I am starting to make more of an effort to publish all of my content onchain — blogs, podcasts, art, or otherwise. I am posting my podcasts on pods.media where people can mint them just like my blog posts on Paragraph (for free with the small fee of which a share goes to me). In addition to posting my blogs on Paragraph, which puts them onchain, I am planning to start publishing those blogs as screenshot essays onchain via Zora, the same place I am publishing my digital art, for people who might prefer that to the Paragraph posts, or stumble upon it on Zora where they might not otherwise have found it on Paragraph.\n\nSo why am I doing all of this? It’s more useful to start with the opposite question — why not? The main reasons why I would not to do this would be if it added a material amount of time to my processes — especially if it added so much logistical work that it discouraged me from doing the actual thing — writing, podcasting, etc.. But the fact is it doesn’t. So long as I setup a system where I can pop open a folder of bookmarks titled “Publish Blog” or “Publish Podcast”, it’s just copying and pasting across a few different websites and filling in some simple information fields that are pretty much the same across all of them. For tweeting and casting, it’s as simple as copying and pasting a tweet from Twitter and casting it on Warpcast or vice versa. There are even some apps that can be used to do this automatically, in one click, though I’m not using them because it hasn’t made sense for me to cross-post in every case, and the manual approach has emerged for me organically and been easy enough. The other reason not to do this would be if it in any way compromised my work — that is, what I do or how or why I do it — but, again, it doesn’t. I’m not meeting people where they are. I’m creating what I want and letting people get it where they go.\n\nIn closing, if you want to follow some of my work, and you don’t know where to start because of all of the different channels I’ve mentioned, don’t worry about it. The whole point is that I am going to do what I do and you can just continue to do what you do and, if I’m doing it right, you’ll see me there. Just look for the blue dot."}]}

Along with fresh strawberries as well as other fruits and vegetables, they sold rose sculptures and Hanukkah menorahs made from the metal of actual rockets that had landed on Israeli soil. I learned at the farm that pigeons are able to deliver mail because, once released, they are led by some magnetic sense in their beak to fly home, with precision down to a few feet. I also learned how important bees remain to the prosperity of humans through their uniquely effective abilities in pollination. Later that evening we arrived at a large tent in the desert. After a meditation led by the Israelis in our group, it was inside of that tent where we slept.\n\nIn the morning we rode camels. It was cool for a few minutes, but I did feel sorry for them. We were told that camels can live longer (up to 25 years) under the “care” of humans, but the value of having free will to roam in the desert seems like it would be worth at least a few years to me.\n\nIn the sunniest hours of the winter day in the desert we hiked through canyons, saw David Ben Gurion’s tomb, and toured Be’er Sheva, which in the last half century has been home to many Sephardic Jews. During that time, the southern city has not been regarded as a place where many would want to go for any reason other than for university (Ben Gurion University of the Negev) or to volunteer. Over the last few years however that has begun to change and it makes me curious to look into whether Be’er Sheva might be an attractive area to invest in through real estate or otherwise at some point in the future.\n\nTomorrow we hike Masada and go see the Dead Sea before making our way to Jerusalem."}]}

If power was purely a product of physical strength, we would have a silverback in the White House, instead of a whitehair. I’m kidding… But seriously, if strength superseded everything, monkeys might be running the world making movies called Planet of the Humans. Obviously, that is not the case.\n\nIt is not the case because, despite our relatively weak bodies, we have extraordinarily strong minds. We are smarter than monkeys and lions and tigers and bears. Most of us are even smarter than dolphins, and dolphins are very smart. Our human intelligence has allowed us to solve problems, plan for the future, and develop increasingly more impressive tools and technologies, from fire and wheels to iPhones and spaceships. That is why we run this planet — not because we are stronger than some other animals, but because we are smarter than all other animals. Our minds are our special strength as a species.\n\nI believe it is generally beneficial to double and triple down on one’s strengths rather than trying to improve upon every weakness. In baseball, if you are one of the top 10 hitters in the world, but you are really bad at fielding, you should not spend 90% of your time working on your fielding and just 10% on your hitting. You should continue to work on your hitting to see how great you can get and either spend the minimum amount of time on your fielding that gets you to the point where you can at least get by, or just sign to play for a team where you can DH (the designated hitter (“DH”) only has to hit — they don’t have to play the field).\n\nThere is a lot of obsession with physical fitness optimization these days. People like Andrew Huberman and Bryan Johnson are treated like deities by their countless followers. Don’t get me wrong — I’ve learned and employed some useful tips from Huberman, and I’m a fan of his podcast, and I respect Johnson’s goal to live an unprecedentedly long and healthy life, even if I don’t love or agree with all of his rhetoric. Interviewing people working to slow and reverse aging has always been a big part of my podcast, ever since my very first episode with Aubrey de Grey, a pioneer in the space who wrote the book Ending Aging. I would love to live healthfully to age 120+. That said, I am not “all in” on these guys or their methods. It’s all a little much for me. I’m all for developing technologies, novel drugs, and therapies that promise the potential to help us live longer, healthier lives, but I am skeptical that the difference between operating at a B+ fitness level and an A+ fitness level will move the needle much in terms of how I feel on a daily basis or how long and healthy a life I live.\n\nIt’s not like its takes 85 units of time and effort to score an 85% on your fitness and only 14 more units to score a 99%. The difference between 85% and 99% requires more like 10x as much time and effort, including a whole host of sacrifices which I’m not very interested in making (i.e. never having another slice of pizza, being a general pain to hang out with, spending hours every day in the gym, and depriving oneself of many of the simple joys in life due to a zero tolerance policy on a lot of things that are more or less harmless in moderation). Not only don’t I want to make such an extreme effort, I actually don’t think it’s the smartest approach. Everything you do has an opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of spending so much time focused on your fitness may be not spending as much time with friends and family, or working, or doing things for fun. Another opportunity cost of spending so much time physically training is spending far less time mentally training — learning, reading, writing, communicating, working, building, etc..\n\nTo over-focus on physical fitness, to some degree, is to spend an exorbitant amount of time on something we are unexceptional at as a species. It is to work on our weakness rather than doubling and tripling down on our greatest strength. I am all for physical fitness to the extent that it makes me feel better on a daily basis and gives me a materially higher probability of living a longer and healthier life, no question, but I am not for piling as much time and effort as I possibly can into my physical fitness. I’d much rather use and continue to improve upon my greatest strength, my mind."}]}

I actually acted in a couple of them back in our college days.\n\nHe recommended that I check out some of the early works from the Safdie Brothers, an eclectic directing duo from New York who, still only in their mid-30's, have become best known for their recently released Adam Sandler featured film, Uncut Gems (I still need to see it).\n\nI decided to watch this documentary they directed on high school basketball phenom Lenny Cooke who famously failed to ever play a game in the NBA after once being ranked a higher prospect than LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. For anyone who likes basketball or enjoys sports-related documentaries, it is an unfortunate and somewhat cautionary tale that is well done and worth a watch.\n\nSpeaking of Carmelo Anthony, I am very glad to see my all-time favorite basketball player continuing to thrive after his unexpected resurgence with the Blazers. Melo is one of the best offensive players I have seen in my lifetime, he can play solid D when he wants to, and I have always opposed the argument that he could never be a part of a winning team. He led Syracuse to an NCAA Title as a freshman in 2003. A winner is a winner in my book.\n\nLastly, as a Knicks fan, I have to say that while RJ Barrett looks reasonably promising in his first year, I always wanted Ja Morant in this most recent draft. I know the Knicks did not have much of a choice as he was drafted by the Grizzlies with the pick before theirs, but I would have certainly considered making a trade to swap picks. The kid is absolutely nasty and these highlights from his last game, an impressive win over the Rockets, are as impressive a set of three plays by a point guard that I have seen in one half of basketball in recent memory."}]}

I even have said without thinking too deeply about the implications that I might not mind if a few of the more powerful governments in the world came together and made some common enemy up for the sake of peace, but that is probably a pretty controversial take.\n\nMore recently, I came to think that the climate crisis might gradually develop into humanity's existential common enemy, but the very gradual nature of the crisis and its impacts serve somewhat as an impediment towards getting most or all of the world to prioritize the issue at the same time any time in the near-term with absolute focus and urgency as we have already seen to some early degree.\n\nOver the the last couple of months, the first of humanity's common enemies in my lifetime has introduced itself in a form that many could have predicted but for which we mostly were unprepared, and the world is now fighting that common enemy together, as best as we can.\n\nThe unexpected irony of this common enemy is that the more we stay apart, the slower it will kill, but the more we work together, the faster it will die. This dilemma presents an extremely difficult challenge, but we as humanity have never been better prepared to face it, and though it will not go without doing tragic damage first, when we do beat it, we should be better for it.\n\nOther common enemies will inevitably arise whether they are extraterrestrial, environmental, or similar to this one only more viral and deadly. My hope is that because of this one we will be more proactive in preparing for the next one(s). It is amazing to see the world working together against a common enemy, and we should do the same in anticipation of things like massive asteroids and natural disasters which can potentially be far more deadly far more quickly than this pandemic has been to date, not to suggest it is anywhere near done.\n\nBecause of the rift developing between the US & China and the inevitability that some countries will handle this better than others and thus be more dangerous to re-engage with as uncrossable borders eventually re-open, I am skeptical that this common enemy will be the one to bring meaningfully more peace to the world. Still, I am seeing glimpses of promise; Republicans and Democrats coming together to pass bipartisan policies, scientists in different countries with different languages working together to find treatments, and Chinese billionaires sending the US resources to help in the battle ahead.\n\nSeparate from this subject, I cannot stress enough how important I believe it is for people to remain responsible for the next couple of weeks in particular as we have not yet seen the fallout of the peak pre-social distancing spread in terms of the number of hospitalizations and deaths that lag behind. Moreover, it is important to remember that the accelerating number of confirmed cases in The United States has almost nothing to do with the actual number of people currently infected or the actual rate of spread and almost everything to do with the accelerating number of people being tested. We have almost no idea how many people in the US actually have the virus but while there is still so much unknown, so much more will be known soon, as in a matter of weeks. While I am trying to choose optimism for the subjects of my writing for the reasons I wrote about earlier this week, I must repeat caution for the purpose of reminding myself and others to remain as responsible as possible in the near-term. Some people may have better ideas than others but no one truly knows how all of this is going to play out. Be responsible and be safe. Soon enough, hindsight will be 2020."}]}

The theory is that, after realizing how tragically we paid for ignoring the early signs this was coming, we will not make the same mistake again.\n\nI have been largely quiet on making any predictions regarding the pandemic since late February and early March when I felt strongly that most of the people I knew personally were underestimating the forthcoming impact of the virus. I will change that today by sharing that I have come to believe history will look back on the early 2020's with more sympathy for the societal impacts of our reactions to the virus than the number of lives that will in the end be lost to the virus itself. That is not to suggest that we should have done nothing or much less, but rather, that we could have done things earlier or differently, and that given the way things have gone, we will pay more severely for what we have done and how we have done it than we will from the virus whose direct damage we will have relatively effectively mitigated.\n\nA fundamental (though incomplete) understanding of my reasoning can be understood by quantifying and contextualizing the death rate from the virus versus the unemployment rate from our reactions to it.\n\nThe virus-caused death rate in the United States as of a few days ago has been 777 people per day since 50 days prior when there were no deaths yet reported. If you take global deaths from the virus and assume they all occurred since the beginning of March (which will overestimate the rate because many deaths occurred prior), you get a global death rate of 3,442 people per day. Compare that with the 3,717 people on average who have died every day this year as a result of road traffic accidents. Putting the death rate in perspective leads me to believe that the fatalities from the virus will seem relatively small in retrospect. It also leads me to believe that we should be doing a whole lot more than we are currently doing to accelerate the transition to safer autonomous cars, but I digress...\n\nThe unemployment figures on the societal side of the damage equation seem staggering. Already today we have a higher unemployment rate in The United States than we have had since The Great Depression. I will not be surprised if the official number surpasses even the highest rate from those years (24.9%) to become the highest in our history. Once it tops out, it will not fall nearly as fast as it has risen. This is and will be an unprecedented level of unemployment in The United States and around the globe and I of course do not know all of the exact impacts that will come from that, but I fear what I do not know and cannot imagine.\n\nMy prediction as I have described it may prove false, but if it turns out to be true, I unfortunately could see this pandemic having an adverse effect on the world's efforts to overcome the climate crisis. Ignoring the unknowable number of virus-caused deaths that would have resulted from apathetic inaction, the same people who are now protesting stay at home orders standing side by side without masks as spit flies from angry yells will soon say with false certainty, \"I told you so\". That is the tricky part for the people who plead to be proactive when it comes to issues like this pandemic and like the climate crisis. If most people eventually listen to them and do as they say, the nightmare scenario that they warned of never comes to fruition, and although it very well might have had they not altered the course of action, no one can ever know. As long as the people who are the earliest to bring attention to a foreseeable issue are able to bring the world to their side, the people who would be the latest to accept its reality never have to switch sides themselves. Instead, they can protest in denial while the rest of the world reacts, and in the end, they say \"I told you so.\"\n\nI do not disagree that this pandemic could possibly help us to more effectively manage the climate crisis. I am a reasonable optimist after all. I am simply hesitant to ignore the alternative possibility. I am cautious that after another potential \"I told you so\", the powers that be may not err on what seems to be the side of caution next time when the stakes are even greater. They may refuse to give in to the advice of the earliest activists because they will look back at this pandemic and see the damage they caused by listening them, without realizing that the easiest way they could have prevented that damage would have been to have listened earlier. The powers that be may instead choose to wait it out, and they may not be around long enough to realize the consequences of their stubborn and ignorant denial. The consequences may not be the worst case scenario that some people fear, but rather, a different awful scenario that we had to choose as the alternative to it. That would be similar to what we are dealing with now, and so I suppose I am not proposing something very new or clever in suggesting that history may in fact repeat itself.\n\nIn many ways beyond its polarization, the current pandemic resembles the difficult decisions we will face related to the climate crisis ahead. As with most issues, there are extremists on both sides. Some, primarily the most politically correct portion of the left, argue that not a single human life is worth sacrificing, no matter what the cost to the global economy. Those people ignore the livelihoods that will be gravely affected and thus the lives that will be lost as a result of economic collapse. I respect the person who has warned of this pandemic since the early days but acknowledges that difficult decisions must be made about what measures we can take to save the most lives and livelihoods overall. Others, primarily the less educated portion of the right, argue that we should let the virus do its damage while continuing on with business as usual. Those people ignore that at a bear minimum there are certain things we can do without negative economic impacts or individual costs or efforts that can help to limit the damage of this deadly disease. I respect the masked protester who is keeping their distance from others, perhaps with gloves on their hands and possibly a Purell in their pocket.\n\nNothing good comes from conversations with people who are stuck at the extremes on either side, living in fantasy worlds of politically correct perfection or ignorant denial. The productive conversations and the critical debates happen between people like the practical activist and the responsible protester. They happen when these people respect each other enough to listen and are reasonable enough to change their mind. Those are the conversations worth having, and as it relates to the climate crisis and all of the other great problems that humanity is capable of solving, those are the ones I hope to see.\n\nNow, as you all know, today is earth day, and while earth's day is largely about protecting it, I want to close on a lighter note, and finally, with a quote about appreciating it.\n\nI did not actually remember today was Earth Day until after I turned on a podcast and went for a run this morning, but it was fitting that I chose to listen to the first hour of a Tim Ferris interview with Jane Goodall, the famous anthropologist who lived with chimps. I learned that there is a special airing on National Geographic tonight at 9pm ET called Jane Goodall: The Hope. In a time when many could use a little hope, or at the very least are having trouble finding something the whole family can agree to watch on TV, this seems like it could be a solid program. I plan to watch it with my family.\n\nLastly, I want to share with you an idea that I had today while running on a particularly beautiful road on an especially sunny day today, when despite a chill in the air, it started to feel like spring.\n\nEarth can be heaven if you believe it, and heaven will never be if you don't."}]}

One person’s problems might not seem significant from the perspective of another person, but they feel like problems to the first person nonetheless. Having problems is a part of being human. Problems are a prerequisite for solutions. We humans are great at finding solutions. Once we solve some set of problems, we identify new problems, so we can find more solutions. Jeff Bezos famously said, “customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great.” This sums it up well in a business context, but it applies more generally as well. Even the people you know who say they are happy and life is great have problems. Ironically, having problems is not a problem. It’s just a part of being human. Our inexhaustible ability to find new problems and new solutions is what has allowed us to prosper as people, and on an individual level your ability to do so is what allows you to grow as a person. Without problems, there would be no change, and without change there would be no progress, no improvement, no evolution, no growth. Humans make progress. We invent. We adapt. We evolve. We improve. That’s just what we do.\n\nStill, sometimes problems can become a bit overwhelming. There is a point beyond which they become detrimental. It is fine to be anxious, sad, nervous, or fearful, but too much of these negative emotions for too long can make for a pretty miserable life. That’s not what anyone wants. It feels better to feel positive. To take a positive perspective is a choice, but circumstances can make that choice a bit easier or more difficult. If you have are stuck in a negative loop of thinking or feeling overly anxious, depressed, or fearful, it can be hard to effectively flip your perspective to be more positive. But I have discovered a trick.\n\nYou may or may not be familiar with the power law or the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. It states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes, but often these numbers are even more extreme. For example, there are more than 2 million cryptocurrencies but just 2 of them (Bitcoin and Ethereum) comprise two-thirds of the total value of all of them. The remaining 1,999,998 combined are only half as large. This sort of phenomenon, to varying degrees, is true in a lot of areas in life. It’s useful to keep an eye out for it.\n\nI’ve noticed it applied to the things I think about as well, and that the same is true for most people. Let me offer an example. Let’s say you are feeling super down about things and have been feeling that way all week. You’re depressed, you’re anxious, and you feel stuck in this negative loop of seemingly endless fears and bad feeling and negative thoughts. It feels like the list of thing you’re worried about is never-ending. Everyone has problems, but you have more. At least, that’s how you are feeling right now. The most important thing to do in this situation is to try to identify the one, two, or three things that are most bothering you. In my experience, and in discussing with others, I find that those 1-3 things typically account for at least two-thirds and sometimes up to 90%+ of what’s the matter. It feels like it’s an endless list of things because you are stuck in a negative loop going from the first problem to the second problem to the third problem and back to the first problem in an infinite loop, and every problem feels new and different when it resurfaces, sometimes in a slightly different form than its prior surfacings. There may also be smaller problems that insert themselves in the loop and distract from the fact that there are only 1-3 problems which together represent the (vast) majority of your problems. \n\nUsually, once you recognize that you do not have a million problems and you only have 1-3 that are really bothering you, that alone should make you feel better. You can then seek to address those problems head on. If you’re three biggest problems are that you’re lonely, you hate where you live, and you are not feeling fulfilled in your job, in that order, you can call your landlord to see if you can terminate your lease so that you can move to a new town or city (let’s assume you work remotely and this is totally doable with work). You can be living somewhere new as early as next month, and you’ll feel better well before that because you’re actively addressing one of your biggest problems. To solve your loneliness problem, maybe you commit to calling one friend or family member every 2-3 days, or force yourself to go out of your comfort zone and join some club or attend some activity, or maybe you decide to get a dog. This is all hypothetical and the solutions will be highly personal depending on an individual’s situation, but you get the gist. If this person can improve their loneliness and place of living problems within a month, and further thereafter, their third-priority problem of not feeling fulfilled in their job probably won’t be enough to make them as miserable as they were when they felt like they had an endless list of problems. Now they are left with just one big one, and they can repeat the process of addressing this top priority issue head on, to clear way for lower priority problems or new problems to fill in their stead. \n\nA normal amount of problems is normal and should not prevent a person from feeling positive and happy and good about life. It’s the temporary times of overwhelmingly negative feelings that can feel hard to escape. When you’re in one of those temporary times, remember the power law. Identify the top 1-3 problems. Address those problems head on. That’s how you can escape a negative loop. At least, that’s how I do, and I’ve talked to others who have had success with this too."}]}

Specifically, I published a blog post every weekday for more than 6 months straight. It’s hard to do that in general, but there was one main thing I did to make it a bit easier. Or rather, one main thing that I didn’t do — edit. I wrote a lot, but I didn’t edit much. Said another way, I was able to write a lot because I didn’t edit much.\n\nEvery weekday, I would sit down to write, and I would edit a bit as I went, just as I am doing now. I might also give it a full read through once I was done, and make a few changes as I did. But I did not belabor the thing. The initial rationale was purely practical. First of all, I had committed indefinitely to a weekdaily publishing cadence, so there was no putting a piece away and revisiting it another day — no sleeping on it and reviewing it with a pair of fresh eyes in the morning. I didn’t have some big backlog of written pieces waiting to be published. For the most part, I wrote every weekday, and I published what I wrote that same day. The second reason I didn’t edit much was that I had roughly no subscribers, no followers, no audience of any kind. I was writing without expectations that anyone would read what I wrote anytime soon, so who cares? I had the desire to write, and again, that includes a fair bit of editing as one goes, but I did not have the desire to edit much after the fact. So that was that. It was write and publish. Just write and publish. One piece out. Onto the next.\n\nLater, when I started my podcast, I applied some of the same principles in regards to editing, and as a result I did not do much of it. For podcasting, I had even further support for this approach. First, Joe Rogan’s podcast is mostly unedited and he has the most popular podcast in the world, so why should I edit? Second, I personally prefer less edited podcasts over the ones that cut out every single pause and filler word and even full segments of the conversation. To me, that feels over-“optimized” and unnatural — plus, a well-timed pause can hold a lot of value in a conversation. Without hearing a conversation as it was, a lot of context can be lost, and a big part of the value of podcasts compared to shorter-form content like tweets or tiktoks is that it provides that context — so why edit it out? Last but not least, and perhaps most importantly, moreso than editing writing, I really dislike editing audio or video. Whereas editing writing feels skillful, editing audio or video, at least in the context of editing a podcast, for me feels like a completely commoditized skill, a robot task, and a waste of my time. \n\nI feared that, if I made editing a material part of my recurring podcasting process required for every episode, I would end up quitting podcasting all together sooner than later because a large part of the process felt dreadful for me. Why spend time on a recurring basis doing something I don’t enjoy when it is not even clear that it will improve the quality or potential popularity of the podcast (i.e. Joe Rogan), and it may actually make it worse for some people’s preferences (i.e. my own)? So I made the decision to do minimal viable editing — a cut at the beginning, a cut at the end, and only editing anything in the middle that stood out as something that obviously should be edited out, like pausing the conversation to fix a problem with our audio connection, or a dog barking and interrupting the conversation, things like that.\n\nIn both writing and podcasting, I believe editing is a counterforce against publishing. In other words, the more you edit, the less you’ll publish, and vice versa. You’re only going to spend so much time on either writing or podcasting as activities overall, and the higher percentage of that time you spend editing, the less time you’ll spend writing, or thinking of new ideas, or finding and sending invites to new podcast guests, or preparing for the conversations. Plus, it’s possible that, like podcasting, over-editing writing can be more harmful than helpful past a certain point, and so the same argument holds as to why one should not waste one’s time on it.\n\nWhile I have held strong on this principle in podcasting, I lost it a bit with writing. As I gained a small following, knowing that some people would be reading my writing stopped me from feeling as free to publish with minimal viable editing. Somewhere along the way, I lost the feeling that I had nothing to lose.\n\nSo this is my public commitment, not to publishing on a particular cadence again, but to publishing with less time dedicated to editing in general. That might seem easier in that it requires less time but it is hard in that you need to sum up the courage to post something you haven’t painstakingly scrubbed for anything that might be poorly written, make you seem stupid, or be otherwise bad. It helps to remind myself of something else I wrote: Nobody Cares.\n\nIn closing, I should say that this does not mean I am going to start posting garbage. In fact, I believe most of the best writing of my life was published during those initial 6 months of mostly posting with very little editing. When I know I’m not going to edit much after, I tend to be a bit more thoughtful as I am writing, in a way that is helpful to keeping things cleaner as I go, and I also edit as I go, but in a way that still feels like a part of the “writing” more than explicit editing. The primary thing I want to do less of is the after-editing. For this one, I’m just finishing doing a full read through. It took more time and I made more edits than I would have liked to, but just like anything, writing and publishing with minimal viable editing is a practice. It’s a muscle I haven’t exercised in a while, and I’ve built some “bad habits” of spending substantial time editing, and not feeling as free to press “publish”. I’m hoping to start changing that.\n\nI doubt you’ll notice a difference from all this — only that hopefully I’ll be publishing more writing more often. You might find a few more typos. Then you might tell me, and I might fix it. So be it. The fact is that I don’t love editing and I don’t love reading my own writing right after I write it, just as I don’t love listening to my own podcast episodes right after I record them. I enjoy writing and I enjoy preparing for and recording podcasts. That’s it. More generally, I just love creating things and putting them out into the world. I believe focusing on the parts of the creative process that I enjoy is the best way to ensure that I will keep creating and sharing for a long time, so that is what I plan to do."}]}

That said, I was sincerely surprised by both the quantity and quality of outreach I received in response to my first request for startup posted just over one month ago as of this writing.\n\nWithin 48 hours of the post, I had assembled of team of six individuals including myself who were interested in contributing to the project in whatever ways they could (coding, funding, design, etc.). This team has been meeting once weekly ever since and will soon have a simple solution to show for it. I look forward to sharing it at the appropriate time.\n\nMaybe most surprising to me has been the persistence of messages I have received weeks after the original post, perhaps because I have not posted another blog since, or perhaps because the idea has struck a chord with many more people than I would have thought, or perhaps because my following is larger and/or more engaged with my blog specifically than I had presumed from its less than 100 email subscribers (99 as of this writing). Perhaps the reception has resulted from a combination of all of these factors and more. Regardless of the reason, below you can see some screenshots (with sender names removed) from a few messages that I have received in the last 48 hours alone.\n\n#1 - this guy is from Europe and there may be nothing I enjoy more than people reaching out from around the world\n\n#2 - woke up with this email in my inbox this morning and haven't yet responded so he may be surprised to see it here\n\n#3 - he typed \"elf\" but he meant \"elad\" referring to my podcast episode with Elad Gil which you can listen to here\n\nThe overall response to my first request for startup has not been quite as crazy as one might assume based on the activity I shared from the first 48 hours and the screenshots above from the last 48 hours, but still, the quantity and quality of responses from these 96 hours alone has been far greater than what I had ever expected to receive from the original post.\n\nAnyway, I am now quite curious to see if the success from the first request for startup can be replicated a second time and in a reliable way moving forward. I tweeted the other day about one of the coolest aspects of all I have been doing:\n\n[URL]\n\nIf in becoming a magnet for people working on interesting things I have also become a magnet for people interested in working on interesting things, it may be that I could regularly post ideas on here which I wish someone would build, and that with a little help from me and a lot of work from others, some of them will get built. From my perspective, I am here to provide an initial idea, a spark to action, and a Schelling point where people interested in working on a particular project can meet. I am also here to connect the people who gravitate to the project through me in this regard, to organize the founding team, and to help them however I can (product, team, funding, distribution) with a small and decreasing time commitment along the way so that I may continue to help new projects get started in perpetuity.\n\nOn the subject of helping new projects get started, let me segue into the first of two new kinds of match apps that I have been thinking about lately which together will serve as my second request for startup, as is implied by the title of this post. If both ideas gain traction, perhaps we will get a 2-for-1 out of this second RFS. With increased expectations after the first go-around, my hope is that at least one of these two ideas will be at least as half as interesting to half as many people as the first one was, and that would be plenty enough interest to build off of and get another project underway.\n\n### Match App #1\n\nThe first new kind of match app would be for the purpose of introducing co-founders. Think \"Tinder for Co-Founders\". The purpose of the app would be to pair technical and business-minded co-founders, builders and storytellers, coding missionaries and product visionaries. I fundamentally believe that many more people could start great companies than those who do and that the reason why many of them don't is because they are missing the complementary co-founder they believe they need to do so. This would set out to solve that problem. Think of it as a place where Woz meets Jobs. An exceptional outcome would be if the pair of founders that starts the next Apple were to meet through this app. Naturally, we will call it Pear.\n\nThe above image I found on Google could serve as inspiration if anyone wants to draft and submit a possible logo.\n\nIn addition to the name and logo, I also bring with the introduction of this idea a proposed mission statement as follows:\n\n> “We believe startups are good for the world. Our mission is to help more start and succeed.”\n\nAs I did with the first request for startup, I will offer a few features of the product which I think could be important and help to paint a picture of what this could be and how it could work. First, it would be important to build an effectively leveragable network through the app so that the users (founders) can help each other, not only the partners who they meet, but the broader network of founding pairs. In this way, the app would begin to function as a founder community and digital incubator of sorts. The company can gradually develop a group of successful entrepreneurs and investors who are willing to share their time with the founders in the community. Think the kinds of people whom I have had on my podcast. Eventually, those who emerge successfully from this ecosystem would circle back to further empower it. It would not be exactly like YC, but it would not be totally unlike YC either. One key difference is that it starts earlier. You typically go to YC with your founding team in place and an idea worked out, if not a company already started. None of these prerequisites are necessary to go and meet your cofounder on Pear. Eventually, it would be much easier to raise money as a pair of founders from Pear than it would be to do so without.\n\nThe introduction of the initial cofounders and the endless list of benefits which would accumulate with time to those in the network would come at a cost of perhaps as low as 1% equity in the company -- and that would be the best part. The whole thing is a bet on itself. The incentives are inseparably aligned. Pear would be better off facilitating the start of one extremely successful company than one thousand duds. What I have described is just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more to be conceived of and done. I personally think it could get very interesting. If it sounds at all interesting to you too, I will look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to email me at jake@blogofjake.com or message me on Twitter @blogofjake.\n\n### Match App # 2\n\nThe second new kind of match app would be for a similar use case as the one Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and whatever other match apps are out there (which I am happily not a user of) claim to be for. The difference between my idea and the apps that already exist is that this new match app would be audio-only. The seed of the idea actually came to me from a scene in the movie Her (from 6:50 - 10:00 if you want to check it out with full disclosure that it is inappropriate) where the main character played by Joaquin Phoenix gets in bed and pops his Airpods into in his ears. Of course, they were not actually Airpods as the movie came out 3 years before the first Airpods were released, but they looked and functioned just like the popular pods which we have now come to know as Apple's latest killer product. Anyway, Phoenix's character puts in his Airpods and tells his headphones' version of Siri, \"go to chatroom standard search\" which, for him, Siri reports back, is \"adult female, can't sleep, and want to have some fun\". This predictably leads to a few options of women in audio-swiping succession who fit the description that he was looking for and he ends up having a nightmarish experience with the one he ultimately ends up matching with.\n\nDespite the particulars and the negative outcome of his experience, I actually think the concept of an audio-only matching app can be quite interesting and does not need to be so explicitly sex-oriented, superficial, or transactional as it is in the movie. Tinder and the others have more or less stooped to acting as such sex-oriented, superficial, and transactional service themselves and actually the reason for my idea to exist in the first place is to offer a more human alternative to those apps. I still think the best app for introducing people in a meaningful way that can lead to more long-lasting romantic relationships has yet to be made, and I believe the answer is audio.\n\nThe existing match apps use some combination of pictures and self-descriptions and sometimes some self-selected preferences to match people. While a broad set of information might be collected, in practice it generally degrades into users making split-second yes or no judgements based on a picture or two which likely doesn't even accurately represent the person's true physical attractiveness as you might perceive it in real life let alone their overall attractiveness including their personality and who they are in a fuller sense. Of course, I am by no means denying the fact that physical attractiveness plays a large part in overall attraction and relationships, but I refuse to believe that it is the only factor for everyone. I think it could be good for people to have the opportunity to get to know each other a bit through conversation before they see each other or read any self-descriptions of one another or anything else that tends to be shallow and put people in boxes that are not necessarily true or fair. In the end, the other person's looks could be a deal-breaker for one person or the other but perhaps they could then part in a respectful and unoffensive way after having gotten to know and like each other at least enough to proceed to the point where they could meet over video or in real life and have a drink or a bite to eat with someone they otherwise never would have taken the time to get to know.\n\nThere would be challenges from the beginning as there are with almost any network effects business but I think that, for example, the problem of going onto the app and not getting matched because there is not enough traffic could be solved by restricting the app in its early days to only operate, for example, between 5-6pm in a given time zone. Another problem could be that the system could be taken advantage of by bad actors but I think there are several ways to prevent that from happening through a simple reporting system or a 0-1 rating system where people can confirm that the person they talked to was not being a blatantly bad actor.\n\nAgain, I think it could be interesting. If you do too, my email is jake@blogofjake.com and my Twitter is @blogofjake.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you."}]}

It was inspired by my brother, a friend from Israel, and the Netflix documentary, Game Changers, which was what turned both of them onto trying a plant-based diet in the first place. I should note that I think it is pretty easy to make people believe almost anything through a well-produced documentary with enough \"experts\" and/or star power. Nonetheless, I figured it would not do any harm to give this disciplined diet a try. At the very least, it would serve as a practice run for No Meat Week (March 1 - 7). After going gluten-free vegan last week, I felt good enough about it that I am trying it again this week (...more observations to come).\n\nIn addition to the restrictions on the diet itself, I also added 16 hour intermittent fasting to the mix. Intermittent fasting is far more familiar to me than the diet as I have tried it for several months out of the past couple of years. A 16 hour fast basically means no eating after dinner until an early lunch the next day. My eating window has generally been from about 11:30am to 7:30pm during the week. If you are a believer in Peter Drucker's philosophy that \"what gets measured gets managed\", you may find good use in the Zero app, an extremely simple tracking app that has really helped me hold myself accountable and fast more effectively, despite my not being much of an app guy.\n\nLastly, one thing that really helps me both with this diet and with breaking the fast strong is the green smoothie. I often have it for breakfast as a part of my morning routine but when I am fasting it serves as more of a fast breaker / pre-lunch. I got the recipe from my mother who is probably the healthiest person I know. Here it is below.\n\nThe Green Smoothie\n\n   2 handfuls of spinach/kale\n\n   12 oz almond/coconut milk\n\n   1 serving of plant protein\n\n   1 pre-ripe banana\n\n   1 serving of frozen mixed berries\n\n   1 tbsp of chia seeds\n\n   A few shakes of cinnamon\n\n   1 serving of Fermented turmeric"}]}

I was certainly not. It may have counted a specific notification or something.\n\nI have used my phone for less than an hour in the last week.\n\nIt’s funny. I have spent many years making intentional changes to how I use my phone — going greyscale, minimizing notifications, designing, and re-designing, and re-re-designing my apps and screens — and now, for the first time, I have gone a week practically phone-free, and it sort of just happened by accident.\n\nHere's what happened. I woke up last Saturday and hesitated for an instance on my initial impulse to check my phone as a part of my morning bathroom routine. The fact that I check my phone during that time was itself a result of many iterations. I used to keep my phone on my bedside table, like most people. I checked it first thing in the morning after shutting off the alarm clock app. I later decided to keep it out of arm’s reach of my bed, and eventually out of the bedroom entirely. For a while, I tried not checking it until after a certain time, at least an hour or two after waking up. But eventually, I decided a quick morning check and put away was not a bad way to start my day, so long as I did not get stuck on it for a long time, or become tempted to treat non-urgent items as urgent, or let them bother me for one reason or another. I decided to keep my phone charging in the bathroom overnight so that I could check it standing up around the same time when I brush my teeth and weigh myself in the morning. It’s harder to get stuck on your phone when you’re checking it in your bathroom standing up.\n\nSo back to the story, this last Saturday, after hesitating to check my phone first thing, I decided not to. After a couple hours of not checking it, I realized I could go the whole day. For about as long as I’ve been iterating on how I use my phone, I’ve been intrigued by the concept of a digital sabbath, or at least a phone sabbath. That would mean no phone from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday, or all day Saturday, or something like that. A weekly 24-hour fast from my phone has always seemed good and healthy. I might have done it once or twice before, but I have thought about it a lot more than I have acted on it. There is always some excuse. But this past Saturday, I had no plans, and no excuse. There was no foreseeable reason why I would actually need my phone, so I figured I’d go phone-free for the day, and I did.\n\nWhen I woke up on Sunday, I was not champing at the bit to get back on the thing. I was much more interested in the possibility of going longer without it, so I started the day that way again, and I finished the day that way again. Monday seemed like a natural morning to break the phone fast after a full weekend, but when I woke up I realized I didn't need it, so I didn't use it.\n\nTuesday arrived and I broke the fast that afternoon, after 3+ days, not because I needed to or even wanted to, but pretty much just to break it. While I didn't need it for anything, there was one thing I wanted to do with it. I wanted to get Signal (the messaging app) working on my laptop and I needed to scan the QR code using my phone in order to re-link the devices. I don’t use Signal for anyone I talk to daily, so it certainly could have waited. I also knew I didn't have any important Signal messages awaiting responses because I get the notifications on my Apple Watch. I just need to use my laptop (or typically my phone) to message back. But I used the Signal re-link as a small excuse to break the streak so that the streak would not become the main thing. I didn’t want the main thing to be to see how long of a streak I could do. I wanted to make this more than a streak. I wanted to establish with myself that I can break the streak for 10 minutes of phone time, then put the phone away again, and continue using it minimally. So that’s what I did. I used it for another 10 minutes or so each of the following days and that’s about all I’ve used it for this week (you can see in the screenshot) — less than an hour in total, and I know it could have easily been 0. Nothing I used it for was necessary.\n\nI wanted to write a bit about this because I’m pretty surprised about how it all happened. I always figured one day I could very intentionally detach from my phone when I finally cut all the ties and replaced all the things I did on my phone with alternative ways of doing them on my laptop or watch, but I did not expect it to just happen like this. So I wanted to assess how it happened, including the simple \"this happened, then that happened\" described above, but more than that, thinking about the contributing factors. I think the most important factor was that, after all these years, I was finally ready to detach, even though I didn't realize it.\n\nThinking about it now, I can see clearly that I was ready in a way that I was not a year ago. For example, it was about a year ago that I started wearing an Apple Watch daily for the second time in my life. The first time was from about 2015 to 2017. I bought the first model when it first came out for the same primary reason as I appreciate it now. I thought it could give me the opportunity to spend a lot less time on my phone. I liked it, and I wore it for a couple of years, but it did not live up to my expectations in terms of helping me to detach from my phone. The Apple Watch didn’t have cellular at the time and I didn’t realize when I bought it that it had to be within a certain range of my phone in order to serve many of the phone-related functions. I could use it around my place instead of my phone, like if my phone was in another room, but I couldn’t go out on Friday night without my phone, which was something I was hoping to be able to do when I bought it.\n\nBy the time the versions with cellular came out, I had lost interest and stopped wearing a watch altogether, but about a year ago, I bought a new Apple Watch primarily for it’s ability to passively track my fitness throughout. I got the version with cellular so that I could go for a run, track the run with my Runkeeper app, and listen to a podcast while I did it, but the cellular ended up being useful for much more than that. For example, I started going for walking calls with just my watch and leaving my phone at home. Over the course of the last year, I got more comfortable with using the watch for more and more things.\n\nAnother critical step was getting the Wallet app working. I usually carried my wallet around when I left the house until about a year or two ago. By then I realized I could use Apple Pay on my phone pretty much everywhere. I knew I could get Apple Pay on my Apple Watch as well, but I never did it because it required me to put a passcode on my watch and I didn’t want to do that. I had to put a passcode on my old Apple Watch in 2017 as a part of my employer’s policy for having work messages on there, and I ultimately stopped using the watch entirely because of that. I had to basically enter a passcode any time I wanted to use the watch for anything, which sort of defeated the purpose of its convenience. Maybe I was missing a setting back then, but this time around a fellow Apple Watch wearer informed me that I could turn on the passcode function to only require the passcode any time I put it on after having it off. Since I usually put my watch on in the morning and take it off before bed, that meant just once per day. This one-time daily passcode was no big deal compared to the every-use passcode I used to deal with, so I turned it on, enabled Apple Pay through the Wallet app, and started paying for everything using my watch. Several months later, it still feels pretty cool, especially since I'm less than a couple of years removed from carrying leather everywhere and swiping cards. I feel like I leapfrogged Apple Pay with my phone similar to how some people in developing countries leapfrogged computers and flip phones going straight to a smartphone. I pretty much went straight from swiping cards to waving watch -- no phone or wallet needed.\n\nSo, as of a few months ago, I could pay with my watch, message with my watch (speak-to-text), make calls, listen to podcasts, listen to music, check my calendar, and record notes. That’s most of what I use my phone for, but there are some other little things as well. For example, when I weigh myself every morning, I usually press a button in an app on my phone (Renpho) which logs the weigh-in so that I can track a bunch of weight-related metrics over time. Fortunately, Renpho has a simple watch app as well which has the same button. I can’t check the history and everything on my watch, but I don’t need to do that anywhere close to daily. I can just press the button on my watch, step on the scale, and boom, data logged.\n\nI thought I needed to keep my phone on me for a bunch of edge cases, like to call an Uber, but this few day phone fast motivated me to identify those edge cases and see if I could solve for them. I feel I was able to do so. With Uber, for example, you can call an uber from your laptop at [URL] You can also use your Apple Watch to call 1-833-873-8237 and tell them your location and destination. There is an annoying little complication where they send you a code to confirm your identity, and since you don’t have your phone (you would not be doing this if you did), you have to end the call to check your texts for the code, and then call back again and give them that code. Still, it’s doable. And how many times a year will I need to call an Uber when I am by myself and not by my laptop anyway? Very few -- I don't use Uber much to begin with. If I'm with someone, they can call it and I can Venmo them, and if I have my laptop, I can call it from there. I added the link to call an uber from my computer to a bookmarks folder on my Google Chrome browser called “Phone Apps”. I added Venmo as well because I can't send those from my watch either. But I do get notifications of Venmo requests on my watch and I can easily complete them when I’m at my computer — no need for a phone.\n\nPodcasts are a little annoying so I’ll call out those as well. I use Apple Podcasts (perhaps there’s a more watch-friendly podcast app). For Apple Podcasts, you have to have the podcast pre-downloaded in order to listen, even though the watch has cellular. It doesn’t make any sense to me, but it’s not that big a deal. You just have to save or download the podcasts from your phone or computer. They’ll sync to your watch next time you charge it, and so long as you do that, they’ll be ready for when you want to listen. You have to mess with some settings in the Watch app (on your iPhone) to get it to store the maximum number of downloaded podcasts that it can, which I think is about 10 saved and 10 downloaded or something like that. After that, it shouldn’t really be a problem because you should never have a queue that is more than 10 episodes long. It actually helps a bit to avoid the choice paralysis of having too many to choose from. It forces you to be a bit more intentional about what you listen to.\n\nIn closing, I would say that being off my phone this week has made me more intentional overall. It’s made me more aware of things. And I find that there is less time in my day that gets sucked away with my knowing really what I was doing during that time. On my phone, I can often get stuck in a cycle bouncing between Twitter, Safari, and ESPN or some set of apps like that, in an endless loop, none of which is really necessary. It’s basically doing nothing while doing something or doing something while doing nothing, whichever sounds more like a waste of time to you. This week, my phone has become a tool that I keep in the drawer and use for Two-Factor Authentication when I need it, which is also pretty infrequent. I’m not sure if it will stay that way, but this week has shown me that it can if I want it to. I could use my phone even less than I use my toothbrush, which is once or twice a day for a few minutes. Don't worry, I always brush well in the morning, but brushing before bed has always seemed optional to me. Maybe I should brush more. Maybe you should use your phone less."}]}

Sure enough, it does. Below are the two charts together. The darker line shows the price according to the left-side axis and the lighter line shows the Google Trends Score according to the right-side axis.\n\nIt turns out that bitcoin's price and its Google Trends Score are quite correlated.\n\nSpecifically, they have had a 72% positive correlation since October 2013. This compares favorably to bitcoin's 26% correlation with the stock market and 24% correlation with gold over the last year.\n\nI should note that the correlation between bitcoin's price and its Google Trends Score was much stronger up until both price and score peaked in December 2017 (98%) than it has been since (59%).\n\nNonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is not to argue about the level of correlation nor to assert causation one way or another (though it seems logical that the price and popularity feed off of each other). Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to make a speculative projection regarding what bitcoin's price could be if and when its popularity (as measured by its Google Trends Score) returns to and surpasses its previous all-time high.\n\nIn order to make this projection, we first must consider the historical ratio between bitcoin's average price and its Google Trends Score on a monthly basis. Let us refer to this as the price:score ratio** for short.\n\nBitcoin's Price:Score Ratio\n\nThe chart below shows how bitcoin's price:score ratio has increased over the last several years.\n\nFor a ratio that has been relatively volatile historically, it has remained unusually consistent for the last two months (June & July) at 729, just 4% short of its all-time high of 758 in November 2019.\n\nBitcoin's price:score ratio has been above 645 for 9 of the last 12 months after having only reached such a level once before, and barely (646 in October 2018).\n\nThe 3 months in the last year during which the ratio was lower than 645 can be fairly easily explained. They took place this past March, April, and May as hype grew in anticipation of bitcoin's once every four years halving event on May 11, 2020. Additionally, people perhaps were searching more than usual for information about alternative assets (including bitcoin) when the stock market crashed ~30% in the early days of the lockdown resulting from the pandemic. Those two factors together seem sufficient to explain the uptick in bitcoin's Google Trends Score over that period. On the other side of the price:score ratio, bitcoin's price fell along with the market, and so with the price going down and the score going up, the decreased price:score ratio over those few months makes sense.\n\nSince the stock market substantially recovered and the halving event came and went without materially moving bitcoin's price, the Google Trends Score has returned to the pre-pandemic, pre-halving-hype range. For the last two months (June & July), bitcoin's monthly Google Trends Score has stayed steady at 13, which is equal to its average from April 2018 (after the peak) through February 2020 (before the halving hype and market crash).\n\nFor some additional context, it should be noted that bitcoin's Google Trends Score has only been equal to or greater than 21 in 7 months since bitcoin's inception and they all took place consecutively surrounding bitcoin's last major surge from September 2017 through March 2018 (with scores chronologically of 21, 22, 44, 100, 55, 39, and 23).\n\nFlying Under The Radar\n\nSufficed to say, bitcoin's average score of 13 since the last surge, excluding the three aforementioned months from earlier this year (14 if we include them), shows objectively that bitcoin is flying under the radar (in terms of its popularity as a search term at least). Of course, it may not seem this way to people who follow crypto closely and daily but the algorithmic and mass-data collecting Google Trends Score should be trusted over any single person's speculative and subjective observation about the current level of hype and attention.\n\nIf you, like me, believe that bitcoin is and has been flying under the radar for more than two years now, the natural question to ask is this. What do we expect to happen when that is no longer the case? In other words, what happens to bitcoin's price if and when it reaches the pinnacle of its next hype cycle? How high might bitcoin fly the next time we see a situation similar to that of December 2017?\n\nProjecting Bitcoin's Price\n\nI believe a reasonable response to this question can be made by applying bitcoin's average price:score ratio over the last twelve months (643) to a Google Trends Score of 100 to estimate what bitcoin's price would be if the price:score ratio stays about constant and bitcoin's popularity in terms of search returns to its all-time high. The price implied by this projection is about $65,000 as is demonstrated by the maximum value in the top right corner of the chart below. Basically, if one believes that bitcoin will at least at some point return to the level of popularity it attained in December 2017, this methodology would lead that person to expect bitcoin to attain a price of at least $60,000 at that time.\n\nThis estimate can be made less conservative in two ways. The first is to assume that the price:score ratio will continue to increase as it has all along (6% month-over-month), rather than calculating the price using the LTM average of the ratio. The second is to assume that bitcoin's popularity as a search term will well surpass its previous all-time high set in December 2017 just as that all-time was more than twice as great as any high before it and more than 8 times greater than the all-time high before May 2017 (which was set in December 2013, perhaps not coincidentally exactly 4 years or one halving period prior to the latest all-time high). I hesitate to call either of these two less conservative assumptions aggressive because they are not only reasonable but actually probable if one is to simply assume that the historical trends will continue in terms of the score and the ratio.\n\nAs such, I will close by presenting a chart which one can use to approximate the price implied by their own inputs for the Google Trends Score and the price:score ratio. In this chart, I show the ratio for the last 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and so on, and use the average year-over-year growth rate between those figures (16%) to project the next twelve months (\"NTM\"), next two years (\"N2Y\"), and next three years (\"N3Y\") ratios.\n\nThe highest price projected on the chart is right around $300,000 based on a Google Trends Score of 3 times the previous all-time high (300) and a projected N3Y price:score ratio of 996 (the LTM average of 643 increased 16% 3 times for 3 years). Of course, this maximum price projection is limited only arbitrarily by the maximums I have decided to present on this chart for both the score and the ratio.\n\nTo Be Continued...\n\nMany people have employed many methodologies in attempting to accurately project bitcoin's price. For example, PlanB's stock to flow ratio looks at scarcity to make one of the more convincing price projections I've seen. My price:score ratio looks at popularity in endeavoring to do the same. This analysis was not intended to be totally comprehensive. My intention was merely to introduce this methodology for others to critique. As such, my hope is that this becomes widely enough read so that I may receive ample critical feedback for further consideration and refinement of the methodology.\n\nAs always, I welcome all outreach to jake@blogofjake.com and any comments on Twitter@blogofjake"}]}

Without needing to concern herself with the responsibilities of social distancing, Mother Nature seems to be enjoying the bliss of ignorance. Many are pointing to the environmental benefits of the economic slowdown that the world has enacted in an effort to limit the exponential spread of the virus. Whether it is causal or coincidence, polluted cities in China are seeing rare blue skies and Italy is seeing boars in the streets, ducks in the fountains, and dolphins and swans in the still rising waters of the Venice canals. \"Nature is reclaiming its spaces\", said Twitter user Francesco Delrio. Closer to home, and in fact, at home, I watched dozens of fish swim in the pond behind our house. My brother found a mouse which had made a home for its pups under the platform on which we keep the firewood. Seeing this mouse reminded me of how bad a reputation the rats in New York give the rest of rodents, just like the people on the show Jersey Shore did for the rest of the people from New Jersey. This mother mouse looked more like a pet gerbil than one of those cat-sized pests that scurry through the sewers, streets, and subways of Manhattan.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nThe Prof G Show \\- a couple of years ago, I read The Four by Scott Galloway. From what I remember, it was a great book about the FAANG companies besides Netflix without which the acronym becomes homophobic in addition to everything else these companies are rightly and wrongly accused of so I will simply list them as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Google. Scott Galloway, sometimes called \"The Dawg\", is a well-known NYU professor who released the first episode of his new podcast, The Prof G Show , last week. I listened to it during my run on Saturday morning and enjoyed the varieties of the formats and the matters of the subjects of the show. He hosted another well-known NYU professor, Aswath Damodaran, sometimes called \"The Dean of Valuation\", as his first guest. Sufficed to say, I will be tuning in for episode #2.\n\nThe Pond - there are pros and cons to everything and while the cons of the whole world slowing down and staying home have been evident and seemingly infinite for markets, small businesses, and individuals alike, it has given some people the much needed nudge to slow down and get back to the basics of food, exercise, and going outside (while keeping a distance from others). I spent all of Saturday afternoon at the pond as my brother did for a little bit longer, my father for a bit shorter, and my mother for a bit shorter than that. We split firewood with an axe, played bocce ball in the lawn, and my brother and I played a couple of games of chess on a board that I brought down from the house which my mother and her brother used to play with their father, my Grandpa Michael, who I never had the opportunity to meet (he died well before I was born). I imagine the pond will get a lot more action and appreciation from my family as long as we are holding it down at home, and in a time with so much bad, that seems good. It was a great day.\n\nJoe & Naval - my Sunday run was the long of the week and I listened to an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience with Naval Ravikant all the way. When I get interested in people I think are worth learning from I tend to go all in for a bit to learn from whatever there is to consume from that person. I mentioned that I listened to Naval's long podcast episode on how to build wealth last weekend. This weekend I listened to his less wealth-focused more health-focused conversation with Joe Rogan, and I am not all the way through it yet, but I have really enjoyed it thus far. It changed my thinking a bit on Universal Basic Income, and while I still think it would be a helpful measure to take temporarily for the extent of this ongoing crisis, I am less confident that it will be the best answer in the long-term in regards to how we can keep people financially and mentally healthy as automation continues to replace jobs like truck-driving and cashiering. There were a few ideas I noted down from this podcast which I will write about in the future, but for now, I will share only one quote which Naval shared which I believe is particularly applicable during this stay-at-home state of the world. The quote is from Blaise Pascal, and it says, \"All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.\" I do not know if all of humanity's problems come from this inability, but I do know the truth in its reality. People are more distracted than ever with some of the smartest people in the world designing algorithms for companies like Instagram to literally maximize the amount of peoples attention they can draw to the platform so that they can profit from engagement via advertising, fulfill their fiduciary duty to their shareholders, and grow into as large and dominant of an organization as possible. The current time presents an opportunity by which many could benefit from not resisting the responsibility to be at home so long as it is a requirement, but rather, accepting the situation and allowing themselves to become more comfortable with being at home sitting quietly alone. As Naval points out in the podcast, the iPhone ensured that no one would ever be bored again, but at the same time it has occupied almost all of many people's time that is not already occupied by something else. The Italians, whose country I have hated to see decimated by the virus, have a saying, \"La Dolce Far Niente\" which translates to \"the sweetness of doing nothing.\" I was fortunate to learn young during my gap year that the less you have to do the more you come to discover what you want to do, and the more you get to do it. Said another way, you can only find the interesting things you want to do by first minimizing the things you have to do, doing more of nothing, and following your interests and inspirations and seeing what happens from there. This was a big part of why I quit my job as an investment banker, to give myself that opportunity.\n\nScrambled Eggs - I already miss eating out at awesome New York City restaurants. I miss writing here on Mondays about all of the great food that I enjoyed over the weekend. I am still eating gluten-free vegan with intermittent fasting on weekdays and eating whatever I want on the weekends but the difference is that, while I used to mostly eat in on weekdays but out on weekends, I am now eating in everyday like most of the rest of us. One of my favorite parts about running is eating after. Food tastes so much better when one is truly hungry. After my run on Sunday, I made myself some scrambled eggs with toast and butter and it was absolutely delicious. I have learned a couple tips in the last couple of years that have made my scrambled eggs much tastier than they used to be. The most important one was from my buddy, McNulty, who I lived with for a little less than a year in San Francisco in a total of four different places as we both liked to move lightly and live differently. He is as great a friend to me as he was to live with and our five month stay in a beautiful home in PAC Heights in particular made for some of the most relaxed and enjoyable weekends I remember. McNulty's tip for scrambling eggs the way I remember it was \"low and slow\", as in, the lower the light, the better the scramble. I learned a few other tips from a MasterClass with Gordon Ramsey including recommendations to use a pot instead of a pan, taking the pot off the stove here and again, and the more butter the better, but McNulty's tip is the best I have learned for the perfect scramble. The next time you cook scrambled eggs, try cooking them \"low and slow\".\n\nStay home, stay safe, and have a good week."}]}

I would propose unsheltered homeless people on the west coast be brought to a gated homeless community in an isolated, centrally located, and economically sensible area. A situational diagnosis upon arrival determines where each person starts in the community. Everyone is provided basic needs like food, water, shelter, sanitation, and safety. There will be opportunities to progress within the community and beyond.

I wrote it 5 years ago in school. The essay was for a philosophy class called Intro to Ethics. I liked the class a lot, partly because I did well in it. This essay got an A. It was about finding meaning in life. I called it Finding Meaning in the Absurd. It is when life seems most absurd that it becomes most difficult and important to find meaning in it. For many people around the world, life has never felt quite as absurd as it does right now. This felt like a serendipitous time for me to stumble upon my old essay, and a sensible time for me to share it. I hope you find it worth your time to read.\n\nFinding Meaning in the Absurd\n\nMany people feel sometimes as though life is absurd. Thomas Nagel suggests this uncomfortable feeling is rooted by the fact that people inevitably take some things seriously in life, but that even the things they treat most seriously are at any moment open to their own incredible and inescapable human capacity to doubt. Nagel argues that when these two mutually unresolvable traits of seriousness and doubt collide, people become momentarily consumed by the feeling that life is absurd. Many manage to ignore this feeling and continue with their commitments through struggles with a sense of purpose and meaning in their lives. Albert Camus suggests that the human struggle to greater heights alone is enough to satisfy a person to feel meaning in life. Susan Wolf counters Camus’ argument stating that the struggle itself is not enough. Wolf believes that to find meaning in life, people must actively engage in projects that are objectively considered valuable. If Nagel and Wolf’s points are defensible, then to find the most meaning in life, one must actively engage in commitments that contain objective value least open to doubt, and in absence of the ability to make that distinction, one must choose the commitments they have the greatest passions to actively engage with. \n\nThomas Nagel raises the disturbing question of whether it is even possible to find meaning in a human life. He supports the idea that human life contains a sense of groundlessness but disagrees with the most common forms of reasoning for it. Many believe that this feeling of groundlessness is due to the fact that “what we do now won’t matter in a million years” or that, “we’re just too small in comparison with an infinite universe”. Others suggest that human life is meaningless because “we all die eventually” but even this idea does not seem to be rational as a possible cause for the feeling that life can sometimes seem absurd. More logically, Nagel argues that people feel on occasion that life is absurd when there is a “collision between the seriousness with which we take our lives and the perpetual possibility of regarding everything about which we are serious as arbitrary, or open to doubt.” (TA, 718) In other words, humans must inevitably be serious about some things, and yet we also have this inescapable capacity to doubt absolutely anything, including our most core beliefs and commitments which we treat with the utmost seriousness. Even the most ironic person in the world, for instance, must be serious about being ironic, and even the most seemingly certain observation such as, “the sky is blue”, could be theoretically doubted and considered an illusion or something of that nature. According to Nagel, it is the irreconcilability of these two inescapable human inherencies, seriousness and doubt, that gives people the occasional feeling that life is absurd.\n\nAlbert Camus considers the famous story of Sisyphus to be a metaphor for the human life, which he views as a repetition of struggles that has no ultimate resolve. He goes on to argue that “the struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart” and so “one must imagine Sisyphus happy” as he rolls a boulder up a hill for all of eternity. (TMOS, 123) Susan Wolf counters Camus’ position with a more demanding view. She argues that there are two interrelated criteria for a meaningful life. The first, a passionate attachment to some commitment or “active engagement” as she calls it, is satisfied by Sisyphus and his rock rolling. The second of Wolf’s criteria, however, deems Sisyphus’ rock rolling insufficient to provide meaning in his life. She argues that “meaningful lives are lives of active engagement in projects of worth” (EE, 458), defining worth as an objective consideration of value, independent of the individual’s preferences and enjoyments. While it is difficult to objectively make the distinction that some engagements are more valuable than others, such a process can be more easily accomplished in considering two extremes. \n\nConsider an example in which two thirty-year-old twin brothers have grown up very differently since a time when they both excelled incredibly in computer engineering during their first few years of college. From that point forward, one of the brothers committed nearly the entirety of his days to playing World of Warcraft on his computer. The other brother spent the decade after graduation inventing revolutionary software while working for a non-profit organization and improving technology on a global scale. The first brother wasted his talents and engagement on fantasy gameplay while the second actively engaged in a valuable career and maintained phenomenal relationships as he kept in touch regularly with family and friends. In this example, the second brother clearly pursued his natural tendencies and most valuable strengths to live his life actively engaged in projects of worth. Contrarily, his detached brother spent years absorbed in a fictional gameplay that addicted him so heavily that he failed to ever realize his playing of the game contained virtually no value outside of the game. Logically, it is safe to assume that most would objectively consider a career spent revolutionizing technology and maintaining close relationships to be more valuable than a devotion to World of Warcraft, and in this way, one could objectively make the distinction that the second brother experienced a more meaningful life. \n\nIn other instances, the distinction of objective value is not so simple to make, but rather impossible. In these cases, when the objective value of varying activities is more difficult to determine, one must choose to pursue the commitment they are most passionate about and thus most inclined to actively engage with. Consider a second hypothetical in which a college senior has a passion for writing and teaching others but also happens to excel in finance and business, though the latter is less engaging of an activity for him. In aiming to choose a career, the young man receives offers to work at three of the top banks, but has difficulty escaping his feeling of doubt that aside from the money, a career in business will only lead to a long career of boring work. He understands that he has the potential to be a phenomenal businessman but does not believe he could fully engage himself in the career and suspects he might end up simply going through the motions. He has no feasible route to begin a writing career but he contemplates the idea of writing on the side while pursuing a career in teaching because he is truly passionate about both writing and teaching. The task of objectively assigning more value to the writing and teaching option as opposed to the banking alternative is difficult, but the confidence that the young man has in his passion and ability to truly engage in writing and teaching gives that option the distinct advantage. This sense of certainty regarding one’s passion and ability to engage becomes the key to finding meaning in life when the values of opposing ways to move forward are objectively indistinguishable.\n\nThere may be no issue more central to the human life than the determination of how one can go about finding meaning within it. Nagel and Wolf provide a framework through which one can defend a system to guide decisions towards creating the most meaningful life possible. One must first consider, in the moment of any major decision, which option contains objective value that is least open to doubt. The second consideration must regard the level of one’s passion and capability of actively engaging in the relevant commitment or activity. Finally, the decision that will provide the most meaning for the individual’s life will be the one in which the objective value or personal passion is superior for one option in comparison to the other. In a world of uncertainty, one must strive to prioritize objective value and passion in an effort to choose the most meaningful path for a life, and pursue it with vigor. \n\nBibliography\n\nCamus, Albert. \"The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays, trans.

The hacker started by selling already in-use Twitter handles for hundreds or thousands of dollars. They then began the \"send me Bitcoin and I will send back double\" scam, first through crypto-related accounts like Binance, Coinbase, and Gemini, and soon after through celebrity and company accounts with large followings including (in chronological order) Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Apple, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Joe Biden, Warren Buffett, Barack Obama, Floyd Mayweather, and Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe hacker made the vast majority of their money through the last part of the scam, much less than that through the crypto-related accounts, and even less than that by selling the usernames in the beginning. It seems like the improvised work of an amateur, but if that was the case, why haven't they been caught yet? If the hacker was no dummy, his scams seem odd contrasted against his ability to have hacked Twitter. One possible explanation could be that the opportunity for the hack was spontaneous and the hacker had little or no time to plan the scam. Another could be that the hacker had reason to believe this scam would generate much more money than it did and that it simply failed to do so. Perhaps the perpetrator was a Twitter employee who did not need to hack anything at all to pull this off, but again, it seems to me that someone like that would have been caught already.\n\nThere is, however, another possible answer that does not solve the question posed in the beginning of this piece but rather leads to the asking of additional difficult-to-answer questions. What if the hacker's goal was not to make money through the obvious scam? If that was the case, what could their ulterior motive have been? In considering this question, it is helpful to think about the impacts of the hack outside of the relatively low number of bitcoins that changed hands as a result of it.\n\nFirst, this is not a good look for Twitter. This is not the first case where Twitter has been hacked and it is the worst case where Twitter has been hacked. As of this writing, there has been no definitive message from the company to suggest that this issue has been fully resolved and that the hacker has lost any and all control. Until that announcement is made, I will consider this an ongoing incident. It seems possible though probably unlikely to me that there could be more damage to be done.\n\nSecond, this is a point for decentralization and a strike against centralization. In this incident, Twitter, a centralized system, was hacked to conduct an unpunishable crime using Bitcoin, a decentralized system. It demonstrates the vulnerability of centralized systems where unfathomable amounts of control lie in the hands of one company or even a single individual. It also highlights the uncensorable nature of a decentralized system where there is nothing that anyone can do to confiscate money that is transacted or to reverse any transactions that were at one time agreed upon. It is important to recognize that all of the money that people lost in the scam was money that they gave away by their decision, regardless of how soon they later came to regret it.\n\nThird, this counterintuitively helps further legitimize the value of Bitcoin, even though it was used to facilitate a significant scam. It speaks volumes about the security of Bitcoin that someone went and hacked one of the largest social media platforms in the world in an effort to steal some. If Bitcoin was hackable, one would have expected a hacker who wanted some to go and steal it directly from people's wallets. Considering the hacker could have made more money by stealing a few relatively small Bitcoin wallets, why would they go to such great lengths to hack the entirety of Twitter instead? It is only reasonable to conclude that Bitcoin must be significantly more difficult to hack. Separately, this sends a loud message that the most impressive hack in recent memory was executed in an effort to steal Bitcoin. In other words, the hacker had the opportunity to send a message through trusted celebrity profiles with hundreds of millions of followers around the world and what was the message that they chose to spread? \"Please send Bitcoin.\"\n\nSince I still have many more questions than answers, I will end by sharing several of them. What if the hacker's main objective was not to make money but to destroy people's trust in Twitter? What if it was to send Twitter's stock crashing down in the near-term and the company down with it in the long-term? What if it was only to demonstrate the dangers of centralized systems? Could this have been a noble act to prevent the possibility of more dangerous hacks by bad actors in the future? I am not saying that it was by any means, but could it have been? What if the hacker sent back all of the money they received from the scam? What if they actually sent it back doubled like they said they would? How would that effect the reputation of Bitcoin? How would that effect the price? Why haven't the prices of Twitter or Bitcoin moved any more than on the average day as a result of this event? Doesn't that seem a little odd? Did the hacker expect these prices to move one way or the other? Was that a part of their plan? Is the hacker not done yet? What else don't we know about? How much could the hacker have made by searching and screenshotting a few celebrity DMs and blackmailing them with that information? Why did the hacker make this such a public event? What if they just hacked it to show that they could? What if the hacker was some Twitter employee's teenage brother or sister or kid? What if they just hacked it for fun?\n\nThere are countless questions left unanswered and I do not know if any of them ever will be. The most likely scenario remains that The Blue Check Hack simply was what it seemed to be, an impressive hack that resulted in an unimpressive scam. Still, it is interesting to think of the possibility that something else may have happened here or that something may still be going on."}]}

And I was like 2 miles down, about as far as I’ve ever gone. I walk a lot further around town, but I don’t usually go far on the beach. It’s harder to walk on sand. And I can’t do phone calls because it’s too windy. Most of my longest walks are phone calls. So I'm not one of those people who says they like long walks on the beach. I like short walks on the beach, and long walks around town. \n\nSo I was about 2 miles down, rounding the corner of the furthest part of the beach that you can see from where I started. I usually turn around when I get there, if I get there, which is rare. It feels natural to turn around once you get passed the furthest point you can see. But once you get passed that point, in this case, you can see a lighthouse.\n\nThe lighthouse is another half mile or so around the bend. That’s a bit of a ways when you’re walking on soft sand. It's even further when you know every step onward means another step back for your return. I’d considered it once or twice before -- going all the way to the lighthouse -- but I’d never done it. I’d only even gone as far as the bend a few times, maybe a handful. But today was the day. I decided I was going all the way.\n\nWhen I got to the lighthouse, or almost there I should say, I came upon an unforeseen obstacle. The lighthouse was protected by a big row of rocks on the water side, and then a fescued dune on my right. I could have climbed over the rocks or through the dunes in around 20 seconds without much trouble if I wanted to, and I would have gone over the rocks out of respect for the dunes, but those obstacles were not the obstacles. The obstacles were the signs on the ropes hanging across both the rocks and the dunes which said “Please do not walk on the rocks” and “Please do not walk on the dunes”. So I had a choice to make. I had 4 options. 1. Walk on the rocks. 2. Walk on the dunes. 3. Turn around and go home. or 4. Retrace my steps back about 100 yards to a path that goes off the beach and into a parking lot from which I knew I could walk to the lighthouse. The fourth option was the most complicated of the bunch, and made for the longest walk overall. But it was the only option that did not involve giving up or breaking the rules. And that was the spark for this story.\n\nWalking somewhere is like working toward something. Sometimes you work for a long time. Other times you give up fairly quickly. If you do go far, a common time to quit is when you get as far as you could have envisioned when you started. It’s rare to continue far beyond the furthest point you could see when you started your walk on the beach. But still, some do. Some pursue the lighthouse. But when you get there, or almost there, so close to \"there\" that most people would count it as there, there can often be obstacles. Very few people get to this point, and of those who do, some might try to take a shortcut. Many would just turn around. It is an easy negotiation to convince yourself that you've gone far enough, that it still counts. But you know what you meant when you went for the lighthouse. You meant all the way.\n\nSo here you are, with a dilemma most don’t go far enough to face. There are effectively 3 options if you combine the rocks and the dunes. 1. Take a shortcut by breaking the rules. 2. Turn around. or 3. Go the extra distance to get around the obstacle and reach the destination. So I stood there deliberating. And I really considered all three options. I justified the shortcut. These rules seem kind of dumb. I'll be through the rocks in no time. I justified just turning around. How much do I really care about reaching this lighthouse anyway? It was more of a casual objective than something serious. This could count.\n\nBut I realized this wasn’t about the lighthouse. This was about what kind of person I wanted to be. “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” So is doing things the right way, and doing the right thing. I walked back 100 yards and took the path off the beach. I walked through the parking lot and to the lighthouse. The final stretch was as pictured below, a glorious approach to my final destination. I touched the black door, and then the white wall, and walked all the way around it, counterclockwise, dragging my hand over the bricks as I did. I touched the door again, and then the handle, and headed home."}]}

I trace the origination of my own persistently positive thinking back to the beginning of my first gap year when, coming off of a miserable freshman year of college, I had taken the plunge into the unknown. I think I recognized that a year on my own while my friends were all in school could get pretty depressing so I instinctually ignored considering negative thoughts as an option. You can't fall into a downwards spiral if you never let yourself peak over the edge. I chose to be positive and I never looked down or back.\n\nPositive thinking is a prerequisite for positive teaching, which I have come to believe is an effective method as a result of my own experiences reflected back at me by two of the best teachers of all-time in their respective sports, Harvey Penick in golf and Bill Walsh in football.\n\nI am currently reading Bill Walsh's book, The Score Takes Care of Itself. Earlier this year, I read Harvey Penick's Little Red Book. When two legendary teachers in their respective games give advice that sounds as similar as what is to follow, it must either be really coincidental or really right. My money in this case is on the latter.\n\nIn his chapter titled, \"Positive Thinking\", Harvey Penick says, \"When I am teaching, I never say never and I don't say don't, if I can help it.\" He follows, \"I try to put everything in positive, constructive terms.\" Harvey explains, \"when you are hitting a golf shot, a negative thought is pure poison.\" He doesn't even like the phrase \"give yourself the benefit of the doubt\" because it \"has the dangerous word 'doubt' in it\".\n\nBill Walsh says similarly, \"Be positive. I spent far more time teaching what to do than what not to do; far more time teaching and encouraging individuals than criticizing them; more time building up than tearing down.\" In his chapter titled \"The Leverage of Language\" he writes, \"You demonstrate a lack of assuredness when you talk constantly in negatives. When attempting to help someone attain the next level of performance, a supportive approach works better than a constantly negative or downside-focused approach.\"\n\nOf course, teachers must not ignore negative actions or habits that must be corrected. Both Harvey and Bill share plenty of wisdom on how best to deliver constructive criticism, but the great majority of their teaching is in positive terms. Positive teaching comes from positive thinking and positive thinking comes from positive teaching. Add some positivity to the way you think, the way you talk, and the way you teach. The impact will be positive."}]}

It was written in the 1940’s but feels as relevant now as ever in what it says about the inadequacy of our most prevalent education systems. I have copied it below for your ease of reference. Have a nice weekend.\n\n“Once upon a time the animals decided they must do something heroic to meet the problems of a “new world” so they organized a school. They had adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running, climbing, swimming, and flying. To make it easier to administer the curriculum, all the animals took all the subjects.\n\nThe duck was excellent in swimming. In fact, better than his instructor. But he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running. Since he was slow in running, he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running. This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming. But average was acceptable in school so nobody worried about that, except the duck.\n\nThe rabbit started at the top of the class in running but had a nervous breakdown because of so much makeup work in swimming.\n\nThe squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of the treetop down. He also developed a “charlie horse” from overexertion and then got a C in climbing and D in running.\n\nThe eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely. In the climbing class, he beat all the others to the top of the tree but insisted on using his own way to get there.\n\nAt the end of the year, an abnormal eel that could swim exceeding well and also run, climb, and fly a little had the highest average and was valedictorian.”"}]}

Every good podcaster knows it is much harder than it looks (or sounds). Today I share a few of my thoughts on the process, minimally edited from a thread of tweets I previously shared on Twitter.\n\nGET GREAT GUESTS: A lot of people ask me how I get my guests. They are quite an amazing group. The answer is simple to say but hard to do. I send a lot of cold emails. The emails are short and I am persistent. I still get many non-responders & maybe laters.\n\nVALUE PEOPLE’S TIME: So far I have not run any ads. I don’t speak an intro or an outro. I know you are coming for the conversation. I value my guest’s time extremely highly. I prep so they don’t have to. No pre- or post-conversation. The time they share with me, I share with you.\n\nGO AUDIO-ONLY: I record audio-only, partly because I enjoy pseudonymity, but also because I believe it makes for a better podcast. Video = distraction. Forget eye contact / how you look and freely refer to your prep sheet. Listen intently, respond thoughtfully. No eyes, all ears.\n\nBE PREPARED: It is not uncommon for me to listen to every podcast a person has done and read everything (except tweets) they have ever written online. I’ve read my guest’s books in prepping for people like Aubrey de Grey, Elad Gil, and Albert Wenger. I could write a book on prep.\n\nFIND THE BALANCE: A challenging aspect of the craft is finding the balance in preparation. Scripted vs. Unscripted. Preparedness vs. Spontaneity. I lean towards over-preparing but there is something to be said for less. It makes you respond more spontaneously. This is the art.\n\nDON’T EDIT: Editing takes time. It’s not particularly fun. Joe Rogan does not edit and he has the #1 podcast in the world. It seems unedited podcasts do at least as well as edited ones, and I personally prefer them that way. Less time + same or better quality = why I don’t edit.\n\nMINIMIZE COSTS: I run an extremely cost-effective podcast (and blog). I am only making ~$20 / month (via Patreon) and I want my personal runway to be as long as possible without pressure to make money. I wrote another blog post about how I do it called A Cost-Effective Podcast and Blog.\n\nThis only scratches the surface of the things I have thought about during these first 50 episodes recording podcasts, but these are some of the points where I think I have a fairly unique perspective. If you enjoy my approach, you might enjoy the podcast :)"}]}

The average view on YouTube is much longer than the average view on TikTok, but they are both called “views”.\n\nThis is advantageous to TikTok (and shorter form platforms in general) because shorter content makes for larger numbers of views. People like large numbers.\n\nIn reality, a YouTube video with 10K views could attract twice as much attention (in terms of time) as a TikTok with 1M views if the average watch time on the YouTube video is 10 minutes and the average watch time on the TikTok is 3 seconds.\n\nThat’s 100K minutes on YouTube vs. 50K minutes on TikTok even though the headline “views” count on TikTok is 100x that of YouTube.\n\nThat’s what I mean by deceiving. The time variable is invisible.\n\nBut we know it’s all about time & attention in the end. What matters is how many people paid attention and for how long. “Views” don’t tell you either. Twitter “impressions” are another story.\n\nPerhaps these platforms could standardize on alternative main metrics like “minutes” and “uniques”. YouTube should be open to something like this. TikTok would probably resist. But then we could actually compare attention across platforms.\n\nUntil then, it’s just deceiving."}]}

Even if my perspective on how to have great ones was good, I would contend that I am still too young to know. All I know is that I still have a lot to learn.\n\nThat said, I am a man of principles and so this Valentine’s Day I figured I would share a “principle for lifelong meaningful relationships” from this post that I read after seeing this tweet, both from Ray Dalio, a man who seems to know a thing or two about relationships. Ray is the founder of Bridgewater Associates (one of the largest hedge funds in the world) and the author of Principles, a book which has been sitting on my bookshelf unread for too long. I have copied the excerpt of the first principle below for ease of reference. Happy Valentine’s Day.\n\n“What creates and sustains truly great relationships (like great marriages and great partnerships) is the unwavering belief that nothing is more important than the relationship.\n\nThat’s because in all relationships there will be bad times and disagreements including very big and important ones, and what is required to sustain relationships through those bad times and large and small disagreements is the belief that no issue is more important than the relationship. It is that belief and the mutual demonstrated commitment to it that creates the willingness to work things out so that the bad times and the disagreements are gotten through together. Each needs to give that type of commitment and to see the other give it in order to have the great relationship. If you both believe hard enough that that’s true and operate as though it is true, it will probably become true, and if you don’t believe it’s true or you don’t act as though it’s true it doesn’t have a chance of becoming true. It is that demonstrated that is true love.\n\nOf course, in the early stage of a relationship there is no reason to believe that nothing is more important than the relationship and that the mutual commitments are there because that hasn’t been well tested. Because of that, you just have to have faith that it’s true and act as if it’s true and then see if the other person does the same. And of course, just the belief that the relationship is more important than the issues will not matter if the issues are really more important than the relationship. So, when facing those challenging bad times and disagreements in a relationship, and when making those important calls of what’s most important, you need to think hard about how important the relationship you have really is relative to how important getting your way is because the decisions you will make at those times either strengthen your relationship or weaken it.”"}]}

People are often shocked when I tell them that. They ask questions like “how are you alive?” and “how have you survived?”. People tend to tell themselves this lie that they need coffee to get by. But the truth is that it’s surprisingly easy to quit caffeine. All you have to do is decide to quit and then refuse to cave. \n\n### STEP 1 - DECIDE TO QUIT.\n\n### STEP 2 - REFUSE TO CAVE.\n\nYou literally don't have to do anything to quit caffeine. You just have to not do one thing (ingest caffeine). That means no coffee, no caffeinated tea, no yerba mate, no matcha tea, no caffeine pills, no caffeinated soda, no Monster energy drinks or caffeinated Monster competitors. No Four Loko, though if that's a problem you probably have others. No any of that.\n\nNow I want to be fully transparent in defining what I mean by \"quitting caffeine\". That means telling you about the foods and drinks with tiny amounts of caffeine that I do consume on occasion but don’t count because they have such a small amount. These things include decaf coffee, decaf tea, dark chocolate (~7-15g), healthy hot chocolate, and coffee ice cream. The most caffeinated thing I consumed all year was probably a few scoops of coffee chocolate chip ice cream in a waffle cone on a vacation earlier this summer. I also had a non-decaf green tea by accident one day in May and was buzzing all afternoon. So if you want to argue definitions, you can find someone besides me to argue with. This post is for practical people.\n\n* 7-15g of 70% dark chocolate\n\nStrategically speaking, any of the 3 hot drinks I mentioned -- decaf coffee, decaf tea, hot chocolate -- make for great substitutes for coffee or any other caffeinated beverage. Given that coffee is the most popular and most highly caffeinated method by which people consume their caffeine, I want to especially highlight the value proposition of decaf coffee, caffeinated coffee's closest cousin. I always loved the taste, ritual, and feeling of a caffeinated coffee. The thing is, decaf offers the same exact taste and ritual, just without the caffeine (or ~97% less caffeine, technically speaking). So if you weigh those 3 factors — taste, ritual, feeling — with equal importance, decaf is about 2/3 as good a regular coffee. You don’t have to give up the taste or the ritual — just the caffeine. Don’t make quitting harder than it has to be.\n\nBeyond finding yourself some sensible substitutions, the rest of explaining how I quit coffee leads me to explaining why I quit coffee. What I mean by that is this -- really knowing why you quit is the best advice for how to quit. If you regularly drink coffee, you are not going to quit caffeine by accident. Not only is it your default state. It is also the societal norm. Why that is, I am not sure. It would be very far from socially acceptable to join an early morning meeting and say “sorry I am a bit slow this morning -- I have not yet had my morning line of cocaine.” It would not exactly fly if you substituted “shot of whiskey” either. But for some reason “cup of coffee” work just fine. They’re all drugs. They’re all addictive. And they all materially change how you feel and act. I am not saying they are all the same, but they are not entirely different.\n\nNow the reason it’s important to realize you won’t quit by accident is to understand that you have to quit with purpose. You have to have conviction. And for that, it helps to have some reasons. It helps to have a \"why\", or many of them. Your reasons may be different from mine which may be different from someone else’s, but I will spend the rest of this post providing some options for you to choose from. You can see which reasons resonate with you, build your why, and hopefully gain enough conviction to quit (and not to cave when a craving comes).\n\n## Reasons to Quit Caffeine\n\nBETTER SLEEP \\- Caffeine blocks adenosine. Adenosine make you sleepy. So caffeine blocks you from becoming sleepy. Most people know not to drink caffeine too late in the day because it can interfere with sleep. But as someone who drank coffee only occasionally instead of daily, I noticed an indisputable impact on my sleep even when I drank it before 9 in the morning. It’s hard to know what impact caffeine may or may not be having on your sleep until you go a while without it for a while. It needs to be more than a few weeks to get past the transition period which is not representative of a steady state. If you have trouble consistently getting a good night's sleep, this would be high on my list of self-experiments to run.\n\nLESS EMOTIONAL VOLATILITY \\- My natural disposition is pretty even-keeled, but sometimes when I drank coffee I would find myself irrationally frustrated by things. It’s a feeling I almost never have in a sober state. For people with high emotional volatility, I would strongly encourage giving quitting caffeine a try. For those on the even-keeled side of the spectrum, further reducing emotional volatility feels like doubling down on a strength, which is generally a good thing to do.\n\nMORE CONSISTENT ENERGY LEVELS \\- In terms of energy, I’d rather have more consistency than higher highs with lower lows. Without caffeine, natural peaks feel more earned and crashes are fewer and farther between. My energy levels are much more consistent now. Also, without caffeine, it’s been easier to figure out what gives me energy and what takes it away.\n\nREDUCE DEPENDENCIES & ADDICTIONS \\- I generally believe the fewer addictions and dependencies one has, the better off one is. Caffeine is at best a dependency and at worst a societally accepted but nonetheless problematic addiction for a lot of people. I feel better off not \"needing\" it at all.\n\nSOBER LIVING \\- Similar to the above point, I generally believe sober living is something worth striving for. This is not something to be objectively proven, but if you agree, it’s a good reason.\n\nSAVE MONEY \\- If a Starbucks coffee costs $5 and you buy 1 every day that’s $1,825 per year, or $100,000 over 55 years, which is roughly an adult lifetime of drinking coffee. 5 bucks adds up.\n\nSAVE TIME \\- While coffee may help you focus, going to get it can be a welcomed distraction. Even just 20 minutes every day is ~2% of your waking hours and life. You can take that back.\n\nSUMMON FOCUS \\- It feels valuable to be able to summon strong focus at a moment's notice without the need for any external stimulant. Learning to work without coffee will train your natural ability to focus. You'll be able to get just as sharp without coffee as you were with it.\n\nREDUCE HEARTBURN \\- Not everyone has issues with heartburn or acid reflux, but I did. Quitting coffee helped immensely. Coffee is very acidic, often drank on an empty stomach, and caffeine itself can trigger acid reflux by relaxing the esophageal sphincter. Combined with some other changes I made in addition to quitting coffee, I no longer need to take a daily medication for heartburn like I used to. That's one less drug and one less dependency.\n\nRESTORE NON-CAFFEINATED BASELINE — I have come to believe that the positive feeling you get when you have coffee is mostly just withdrawal reversal disguised as an additive boost. Over time, your sober baseline falls and the caffeine just brings you back to what used to be your sober baseline. At least that’s what I found & wrote about here, but do your own research.\n\nHIGHER BAR FOR WORK \\- It seems to me that a lot of people use caffeine to chemically induce themselves to do work that they otherwise don’t have the desire to do. If you remove the caffeine, perhaps you will be forced to find work that you actually want to do.\n\nIn court, you are innocent until proven guilty. Conversely, I believe the lifetime daily use of any drug should be considered harmful until proven beneficial. If you agree, that means your rationale for taking caffeine daily should be very strong. Not taking it should be the default.\n\nSo with all of those reasons above now stated, I didn’t necessarily need any reason to stop consuming caffeine. Rather, I couldn't come up with any reasons that strongly enough justified continuing to do so. Just because everyone else does something doesn’t mean it’s a good thing. So why are you drinking caffeine, really? Are you absolutely certain it’s worth it?"}]}

That is to say, it is likely that I have deliberately (and often extensively) considered many more aspects than one might assume. Just a few examples... There is a reason there are no comments. There is a reason there is no menu. There is a reason I don't use Substack. There is a reason for the blue dot. There is a reason I do not use clickbait titles. There is a reason I do not do substantial pre- or post- calls with my podcast guests (great respect for and appreciation of their time). There is a reason my podcast has no intro or outro (great respect for and appreciation of yours). There is a reason I don't share my last name. There is a reason I don't have an about page. There is a reason I don't show my face. In fact, there are many reasons for many of these things.\n\nI am conscious of the fact that all of my choices come with certain trade-offs. My text conversation with my friend, the contrast between Taylor Swift and The Street Singer in Thailand, that all boiled down to the trade-off between popularity and creative liberty. The former translates to money and fame while the latter just is what it is -- freedom. I believe that if I continue to write about exactly whatever it is that I am inspired to write about, there exists a certain subset of people in this world who will love it exactly the way it is. Of course, I haven't found too many yet, but I have found a few.\n\nI don't want to create certain content because I know it will be better received. I don't want to spend time on marketing, which is defined as \"the action or business of promoting and selling products or services\". I don't want to sell you on my content. I don't want to use any tricks. I want people to find and consume my content based on the merit of my content alone. I want that content to be honest and all mine. Perhaps that is naïve, but perhaps naïveté is the way to do anything different. I think where I differ from a lot of people is not only in the fact that I have little interest in being ordinarily successful, but that I also have little interest in becoming extraordinarily successful by means that are ordinary among extraordinarily successful people.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I don't want to be singing on the streets of Thailand either, but I believe that with patience and persistence I can have the best of both worlds. In closing, I will leave you with a classic song which does a great job of communicating in a sense what I am trying to say. It is a song you may have heard by a singer you may know well. It is My Way by Frank Sinatra."}]}

I googled to see if there was an originator of the quote to give credit to and it came up as Tim Tebow. I am doubtful that he was the first to say it.\n\nNonetheless, I think this is generally a good rule to follow. It sounds simple enough, but the hard part is determining the lines between what you can and cannot control.\n\nFor instance, if I am negotiating for a house and it is listed for $10 but I really want it for $9 even though it may already be the cheapest house in the world (actually it is not), I cannot control your willingness to sell me the house at my desired price. That said, it is hard to argue that I could not influence your willingness based on my ask or method of negotiation or a number of other things which I can control. To demonstrate, if I were to say, \"I will buy the house for $10\", it is safe to say that my chances of getting it for $9 would be lower than if I were to say, \"I can offer you $8\", in hopes of receiving a counteroffer. It is important to note that I cannot control your decision but I can influence it through choices that I can control. By Tebow's rule, I should not worry about your decision, but rather, about my choices that could influence it. That sounds like a sound approach to me.\n\nA less ambiguous example is the infinite number of things that have already happened in the past. I cannot imagine a good argument to suggest anyone could control the past, but you can certainly control how you choose to move forward from it, or even how you choose to remember it. You may not be able to change what actually happened but you can control choices which can change some of the influences that come from the results of the past.\n\nDespite the fact that we often lack absolute control, we have these constant choices that we can make every day which can influence things or change the influences that things have, on ourselves especially. I believe that we (myself included) forfeit most of these choices to the defaults of the systems that we live in, while at the same time, we suffer from wishful thinking that we can control a lot of things that we cannot.\n\nIn short, I think we tend to underestimate our choices and the power that they can have while overestimating our control over things we cannot have any over. I might even go so far as to say that our control is limited exclusively to our choices, but our choices are so expansive that we mistake the impacts and influences that they can have for illusions of control.\n\nA good rule of thumb, I think, is to focus on the choices we have when we feel the need to change something that is out of our control. You may not be able to change that thing, but you can change something."}]}

The only question is, to what degree?\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar, a Rolling Fund is an AngelList-invented investment vehicle which allows GPs to raise funds publicly and quarterly. For those who do not know what a GP is, a General Partner (\"GP\") in this case is an investor raising funds to invest in startups. You can think of GPs traditionally as venture capital firms. GPs raise funds from Limited Partners (\"LPs\"). You can think of LPs traditionally as large sources of money such as endowments, family offices, or high net worth individuals.\n\nThere is an ongoing trend in the startup investing ecosystem where it is becoming easier and more popular for individuals to succeed as GPs and/or LPs all on their own. These individual GPs and LPs have been coined solo capitalists and micro-LPs, respectively. Rolling funds seem poised to accelerate the rise of both solo capitalists and micro-LPs by making things easier and more attractive for each.\n\nFor solo capitalists (individual GPs), rolling funds shift the fundraising process from private to public, physical to digital, and periodic to recurring. Additionally, all of the administrative work is handled by AngelList so there is no friction in running a fund.\n\nNaval Ravikant, the Silicon Valley guru who came up with the idea for rolling funds, described their function simply -- \"Raise anytime, raise anywhere.\" I might take this one step further to say -- \"Raise anytime, anywhere, from anyone, by any means.\" Admittedly, \"anyone\" really means any accredited investor and \"any means\" really means any means within the confines of the law, but it is close enough to demonstrate the power provided to solo capitalists by the innovation of rolling funds.\n\nBy eliminating the need for 280-day Sand Hill Road-shows and replacing them with 280-character tweets, rolling funds empower individuals with followings to become as formidable fundraisers and investors as traditional venture capital firms if they have the skill for it. Prime candidates for raising rolling funds include Twitter blue checks, Instagram influencers, and bloggers or podcasters or YouTubers with many subscribers, particularly those with demonstrable track records in investing or established expertise in a valuable niche.\n\nFor micro-LPs (small LPs), rolling funds decrease the price to play, increase startup exposure and portfolio diversity, and enable individuals to invest in other individuals, which could create a powerful loop.\n\nPaul Anderson points out that a micro-LP can invest, for example, $5K in 5 GPs for 2 years. If each GP averages 10 investments per year, the LP gets a piece of 100 startups for their $200K of committed capital, which is typically what it would take to gain entry into a single VC fund. A single VC fund may well invest in 100 startups over the longer life of its fund but the diversity would not be as great nor the deployment as rapid as it would be by 5 rolling fund raising individuals investing in parallel. The commitment can also be shorter term (i.e. minimum 4 quarters) making it easier for micro-LPs who can be more agile than larger LPs to stop funding a GP and re-allocate their capital elsewhere practically at will.\n\nBeyond the impact that rolling funds will have on solo capitalists and micro-LPs, they may also make things easier for the startups themselves. On the one hand, rolling funds will accelerate the availability of capital from this new category of empathetic early-stage investors who startups can turn to instead of, or in addition to, more traditional VCs and angel investors. On the other hand, I could see rolling funds becoming roll models (misspelling intentional) for startups who may seek a way to raise less money with less effort on a recurring basis the same way that rolling funds are enabling solo capitalists to. While this may have seemed like an impossible structure to convince a traditional VC or angel investor to commit to only several months ago, it now seems at least feasible that startups could begin raising rolling rounds from rolling funds in the near future.\n\nI am excited to see how the innovation of rolling funds impacts early-stage investing. I would certainly consider raising one and investing in others if I had a larger following and was an accredited investor. Hopefully, one day soon I will have one, and I will be one.\n\nFor those who want to learn more about rolling funds, below are all of the resources I have read to date to gain my understanding of the innovation.

In total, over the last several months since I started writing, the blog has been read by people in 92 different countries. Below is the map of what that looks like. If you have a friend in Greenland, send it their way. I am trying to paint the world pink.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\n17 miles \\- I ran 17 miles on Sunday. I am now well into uncharted territory. In my first 25 years, I had run one half-marathon on a morning of sheer will and determination. Besides that, I had only run further than 3 miles a handful of times. My second longest run was 5 miles, which was why the half marathon was so crazy at the time. Now, on 3 of the last 5 Sundays, I have run a half marathon, 15 miles, and 17 miles. I am probably going to run a marathon soon. I feel so fortunate not to have had any injuries throughout all of this running (knocking on wood as I write this). It is good to be 25.\n\nBanana bag \\- For the long runs recently, I have brought along with me a bottle of this drink that I like called Roar. I like the Georgia Peach flavor. For the 17 mile run this weekend, I figured I should bring a snack too. I looked up what was recommended and ended up pocketing a small ziploc bag with a banana broken into quarters and a handful of raisins as well. I cracked open the bag around the 9 or 10 mile mark to have my snack on the run. The 4 pieces of banana had held their form relatively well in my pocket but had definitely changed a little bit. They looked almost caramelized as if they were ready to be served as part of a banana foster. Most of the raisins seemed to have selected one of the 4 chunks of banana to stick with. I popped the first piece. It was delicious. I had no idea this concoction had been slow-cooking in my pocket by means of consistent motion and body heat. The good news is that I discovered a surprisingly tasty snack. The bad news is that it takes a tremendous amount of time and effort to prepare. The official recipe is to cut a banana into four pieces, put that in a ziploc bag with a handful of raisins, put the bag in your pocket, and run ten miles in 70 or 80 degree heat. Enjoy.\n\nFerriss & Naval - I listened to a podcast during my run as usual. This was a great one. It was a two-hour conversation between Tim Ferriss and Naval Ravikant, two people who have influenced me a lot through things they have written and said. They talk about everything from morning routines and identifying great founders to their favorite books and how to read them. At one point, Naval talks about how he became a healthier eater simply by getting a teppanyaki grill. He says the freshness of eating meats and vegetables just seconds removed from the grill is as enjoyable as any of the unhealthier foods he used to enjoy instead. Humans evolved eating around the fire cooking food bite by bite. It is instinctually pleasant. I had a couple great experiences eating out at places with teppanyaki grills with my buddy Eric in Japan. I am thinking about getting one now myself.\n\nMr. Feynman \\- On the podcast, Tim & Naval talked about their mutual admiration for the famed physicist, Richard Feynman. I had started his book Six Easy Pieces several weeks ago but never got past the first few chapters. I think I will revisit it at some point, but first I want to check out Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!. It sounds more biographical than physics-focused. Last night, I watched this 50 minute interview with Mr. Feynman called The Pleasure of Finding Things Out. I gathered from the chapters I read of his book that he must have been an extraordinary teacher and this video goes to show that. He talks about how he picked it up from the way his father taught him when he was young. He talks about the importance of treating work like play, the concept of \"active irresponsibility\", and the difference between saying one knows something and legitimately knowing something. Mr. Feynman seems like an exceptionally curious character and I look forward to learning more about him and his teachings of physics and otherwise."}]}

That pressure to know only increases with time.\n\nEntering college, you are faced with a less direct but more serious version of the same question. “What are you studying? What’s your major?”\n\nIf you answered firefighter, NBA player, or actor when you were a kid, you might answer computer science, economics, or physics by this point.\n\nYou’re on the precipice of knowing what you want to do for the rest of your life, studying the subject that will best prepare you to succeed on that path. Or at least, you feel that you should be.\n\nYou enter the working world and begin your career. It’s not what you said you wanted to be when you grew up when you were a kid because it’s one of those jobs that you wouldn’t have known how to describe even if your father did it. You’re a software engineer for a human resources SaaS company, or an equity research analyst in the healthcare group at a global financial institution. No seven-year-old has ever aspired to such things. But here you are. You have a good job. You’re making good money. Your learning and you even feel at least a little useful. But something’s wrong, or so you think…\n\nThis doesn’t feel like the thing that you want to do for the rest of your life. I have some good news for you:\n\nThat’s fine.\n\nYou should not be expected to be doing what you expect to be doing for the rest of your life in your 20s or even your 30s. You should not expect to know what you want to do for the rest of your life by then either. Nor should you have known when you were entering college, nor when you were seven years old being asked what you wanted to be when you grew up, obviously.\n\nFor you to know what you want to do for the rest of your life, at least two things must be true. First, it must be true that there is something that you will do for the rest of your life starting at some point. This, in fact, is not true for a lot of people, and increasingly so as the universe of jobs and possible things to do is changing faster than ever and people’s careers are trending towards being more dynamic and evolving than ever. Second, in order to know what you want to do for the rest of your life, the thing that you want to do must be something existing and known. As such, encouraging an early answer to this question encourages people to pursue existing paths which tend to be less uniquely suited to their strengths than something less easily label-able which they might be able to create for themselves over time. Those two issues alone are enough to make this a relatively bad question, and probably not the one worth trying to answer first and foremost above all other questions when it comes to figuring you what you want to work on and get paid to do.\n\nLet me propose a different question. Rather than asking yourself at every step you take in your career whether this thing you are going to do next is going to be what you are going to do for the rest of your life, or at least has a chance to be, ask yourself the following instead:\n\n“Does this seem like a worthwhile experience?”\n\nThis includes considering aspects of the experience outside of the job itself — where you will live, what you will do outside of work, how it might impact your health, relationships, etc.. You are not looking for the end all be all here and you are not focusing on the work experience in a vacuum without considering the many other important elements in life. You’re aware that a perfect solution of something you will do for the rest of your life may not even exist. If it does exist, you’re aware that it may take a long time to get there. You’re fine with that. For now, you are simply looking for a worthwhile experience. You are looking for improvement, even it is incremental. It feels good to improve and it feels good to do things that feel worthwhile. Go for that. A life of worthwhile experiences is a worthwhile experience, and isn’t that more important than finding some societally encouraged straight-forward career to follow for your whole life? Doesn’t that sound more worthwhile?"}]}

This was more than doubling down on the number of Tesla shares that I already owned at that point. In total, more than half of my liquid net worth was now in Tesla. Any traditional investor will tell you that it is never smart to have such a high percentage of your money invested in a single asset, let alone a stock like Tesla which is one of the most volatile stocks in the market.\n\nIn this case, it worked for me. Perhaps it was smart. Perhaps it was lucky. Most likely, as with all investing, the success came from some combination of both. If I simply held onto all of my Tesla shares from then until now I would have more than doubled my liquid net worth in less than a year. The price today opened just under $800. My decision to buy a lot at $212.88 made it one of the best investments of my life. My decision to sell made it one of the worst. It could have been so much better.\n\nLet me explain how and why I sold before getting to the lessons that I took away from all of this. With such a large percentage of money on Tesla, my plan before I bought the latest lot was to sell a bunch of shares once I broke even on my overall investment in the company. I was down on the position that I held before my latest buy and buying more would allow me to breakeven overall at a lower price by lowering my average cost per share. I executed that plan just as I designed it and lightened the load significantly exactly one month after doubling down. This enabled me take a lot of risk off of the table and hold onto the rest of my shares which were now in the green. Additionally, the week that I sold was the same week that I quit my job, and without a steady flow of significant income in the foreseeable future, I knew that I needed to de-risk my portfolio. Lastly, I did not want to be following stocks closely on my phone while I was traveling the world and when I am invested in a number of things I naturally tend to check on them often. For a number of reasons, I knew taking most of my chips off of the table was the right thing to do. I sold the majority of my shares at $241.81. Just five months later, I watched those share pass a price of $900. Trust me, it was a tough pill to swallow.\n\nDuring my travels, I ended up selling the remainder of my shares in Tesla at a higher price but also much lower than where it is now. I sold at $335. In all, my Tesla profits were still significant. They paid for the entirety of my travels. I made good money and I cannot complain, but I could have made so much more. As with most learning experiences, it was a bit painful to go through, but I have taken away a few lessons in investing as a result. I choose to believe everything happens for a reason. If I had to guess, the lesson of selling too soon on Tesla will help me to make better investment decisions now and in the future which will have much greater positive impacts than this one did a negative.\n\nHere are a few of the specific lessons that I am taking away:\n\n  1. Know the why for what you do \\-- Because I knew why I was selling the majority of my shares when I did, I cannot look back and fault the trade. Sure, it would have been great to have held, but it is simply not the move to take that kind of risk when one is out of a job. Looking at the stock's movement in retrospect, it becomes obvious that I should have held, but that future was far from guaranteed, and I can look back with the comfort of knowing why I did what I did, and still believing it was the right thing to do. If you have great confidence in your reasoning, its correctness will persist regardless of what happens later. That will make it easier to live with the consequences if you miss out on a big gain like I did, which is a much better way to fail by the way than getting caught with a big loss.\n\n  2. Always own a piece of what you believe in \\-- When I sold the remainder of my shares at $335, I should have held on to some. Unlike selling the majority of my shares when I broke even and was about to quit, this is a trade I would do differently next time. I sold at $335 because the stock had popped to that level on a positive earnings report and the new price represented a 50% gain in a month. I still had a lot of money in at that point. I was excited to lock in my winnings and wait on the sidelines for a lower price at which I could buy back in. This showed an over-confidence in my ability to predict its short-term movements. That is not the game that I want to play anyway. The stock never fell. Instead, it turned out to be the beginning of a meteoric rise. From the experience of having to watch that over the next several months, I learned to hold onto small investments in the companies I believe in, even if I might think they are going to go down in the short-term. There may never be an opportunity to buy lower, and the potential small loss on a small investment is easier to swallow than having to sit and watch one of your favorite companies succeed while you are standing on the sidelines. Keep a small amount of money on the board and you can continue to root for the company with little at stake. If it goes up, your only regret will be that you did not buy more. If it goes down, buying more at a lower price will balance out your average cost per share, and so long as you still believe in the company, you should be comfortable holding for the long-term from there.\n\n  3. Do not let past mistakes cloud future decisions \\--This last lesson took me a while to learn. In a way, it is about not falling prey to the sunk cost fallacy. About 5 weeks ago, Tesla fell to its lowest price since its massive rally. It dropped to around $360 which was just about 7% greater than the price at which I last sold shares at $335. I was excited to finally have the opportunity to get back into Tesla at the same price that I had previously gotten out. This was foolish. In waiting for the stock to fall below $335 only because I wanted to fully nullify my mistake from the past, I missed an obvious buying opportunity in its entirety. Before I could get my hands on some Tesla shares, they quickly flew back up to the 400s, and then the 500s, and then the 600s, and so on. As I write this, it is trading at $799.\n\n\n\n\nThe company's Q1 earnings report after the market closes today should send it flying in one direction or the other. A combination of the first two lessons and my most recent realization of the third led me to buy one share of Tesla on Monday. I bit the bullet and bought it at $785.58 after having last sold at $335. Do not let past mistakes cloud future decisions. Always own a piece of what you believe in. Know the why for what you do."}]}

I read that this past weekend (its 19th of release), the movie grossed about twice the amount of its previous best weekend (its 5th of release) due to a significant boost from the Oscars, which was what ultimately motivated me to see it, despite not having watched the Oscars at all, and so I suppose if you have not seen it yet, next weekend will be a popular one as well.\n\nI will endeavor to write the next sentence about the movie without giving anything away for those who have yet to see it, rendering unnecessary any disclaimer of a spoiler alert. My two favorite dialogues were the one about schizophrenia at the kitchen table and the one about planning after the rain.\n\nRelated to the latter of the two aforementioned dialogues, when it comes to planning, I think there is a logical truth in the idea that the only plan that never fails is no plan at all. I do value a lifestyle based on spontaneity. More than most, I enjoy playing things by ear and going with the flow, especially on weekends. Still, to consider planning to be useless and point to frequent failure as a rationale for never making any plan at all I think would be a disservice to self for most people. I believe that short-term plans can be very useful, mostly because they can be achieved with a higher probability of success than a long-term plan. I do not make many plans further than 3-6 months out, and if I have a plan or two that extends beyond a year or two, I generally understand that it is very much subject to, and in fact, more likely than not to change. It takes discipline not to plan because planning projects purpose and purpose brings comfort. In the long run, however, not planning too far ahead can actually make life more comfortable because one will not try to force the happenings of life down a predetermined path that may loss its sensibility over time. Whether one does not make plans at all or simply maintains a willingness to change them to me is not very important, but a plan without compromise is a plan destined to fail, most of the time, I have come to believe.\n\nTaking that all into consideration, for the foreseeable future I will plan to title my Monday blog posts \"The Weekend Miscellaneous\", and to write a bit about some miscellaneous things from the prior weekend including places to eat, movies to see, and anything else I feel like writing about really.\n\nValentine's Day Movies - Besides Parasite , which I should explicitly say I thought was excellent and rightly deserving of all of its acclaim, I saw one other movie this weekend. Before Sunrise (1995) is the first in a romance trilogy that also includes Before Sunset (2004), and Before Midnight (2013). I am not familiar with any other trilogy in which the intervals between releases are 9 years and the leading actor and actress remain the same and so that aspect alone I find to be pretty intriguing. I have not seen the second or third of the series but the first was somewhere between good and great for me. A google search of the third in the series brings up a top notch assortment of other movies in and around the love story genre including Titanic , The Notebook , Her , and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , all of which are firmly in the category of great movies which I recommend more highly than Before Sunrise , which I also recommend.\n\nValentine's Day App - Bedford is a messaging app designed exclusively for a person and his or her significant other. It was created by Joshua Kushner (investor / entrepreneur / Jared's brother) as a Valentine's Day gift for his wife Karlie Kloss (fashion model / entrepreneur). I am not sure how much more time, money, or effort Joshua plans to invest in the app but I actually think it could have tremendous success and I recommend it to anyone who is intrigued by the concept. I wrote the company to give two small pieces of critical feedback that the automatic deletion of the messaging history should be optional and the ability to send gifs should be added.\n\nF&F Pizzeria \\- this is a pizza shop that opened last fall in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn. The two Franks for whom the pizzeria is named already had a very successful duo of establishments on the street and the addition of this pizza place between Frankies 457 Spuntino and Frank's Wine Bar makes it a trio. Black Gold Records sits between the pizzeria and the wine bar and I imagine the owner feels like he has the Community Chest between the three green avenues on the Monopoly board. I found F&F on my twitter feed thanks to this tweet from Fred Wilson, the Union Square Ventures co-founder whose blog served as the initial inspiration for me to create mine. The garage looking space with quiet outdoor seating in the back serves very high quality New York slices, with or without cheese, as well as Sicilian squares, though they were out of those when we were there on Sunday. While I love all pizza, I generally prefer Neopolitan to New York style and it is tough for me to compare a pizza in one style versus the other. That said, in the New York category, F&F ranks up there with the best of them.\n\nDi Palo's \\- on Saturday, we picked up a few things from my favorite Italian meat & cheese shop in the city. Di Palo's also carries stellar selections of pastas and sauces, frozen raviolis, crackers and cookies and other items for the cabinet as well. It is on the corner of Grand & Mott just off the main Mulberry strip of Little Italy, and it is a phenomenal place to go and pick up at least a quarter pound of prosciutto and some cheese."}]}

The common hope is that 2021 will be better. I myself share the same hope but not the same sentiment. I am not writing to argue that 2020 was a great year, just that every year is what you make of it. Certain things will always seem to be happening to you, but can you make any of those things happen for you? Can you find silver linings on stormy days? Can you find a positive perspective in a world of negative news where people are yelling past each other all over the internet, and now in the streets of our cities?\n\n2020 was a year of abnormal change. That much is true. But on a macro level, what if this pandemic prepares us for fending off a much deadlier one that could present itself in the future? What if the production of a vaccine in under a year gives more ambitious teams the courage to pursue their projects which were previously considered impossible? What if the lessons learned by the rest of the world in watching America’s failures from limiting testing early to saying masks are bad encourages them to experiment more with their own variations of regulations, playing a game of \"attract great citizens\" rather than \"follow the leader\"? What is the upper bound on the good that could come from a world of experimental and competitive governance where large tech companies are no longer the only large and powerful organizations doing the innovating around the world?\n\nOn a micro level, there are certain things that are just plain tragic. I know a lot of people had to deal with these things this year and I sympathize with them. I don’t mean to offend them or take away from their pain. The death of a family member or close friend is something I fortunately don’t have much experience with and so for me to say much of anything on the matter would be ignorant. What I will say is that I know a lot of people did not face true tragedy in 2020. I know a lot of people are simply taking the excuse that 2020 has given them. I hear this sentiment that 2021 will make everything better. I do believe 2021 can be a better year for a lot of people, but the year itself or the change in macro circumstances which it may bring will not provide the impetus. You have to make this a better year yourself. You have to take the punches and deal a few of your own. No one will fight for you like you will fight for yourself. No one is coming to help you. You have to help yourself.\n\nI can’t remember a year I hung out less with friends than in 2020. I can’t remember a year I left the house less than in 2020. I can’t remember a year I’ve seen more fear than in 2020. But these must not all be bad things. Seeing friends less has made me appreciate them more. Staying home has helped me learn to find contentment where I am versus thinking it awaits at some future destination. Seeing fear has helped me realize when it is useful and when it is not and how significantly it drives us in our everyday lives. Without many of the changes brought by 2020, I would not have had many bonus months living home with my family. I almost certainly would have found a new employer. I definitely wouldn’t have written this post, or the ones earlier this week, or many of the 200+ I have written in the last year or so. I would have never spent a month in Charleston with Lauren, nor a month in Blue Ridge, Georgia. I would have never started my podcast! What an amazing ride that has been for the first few months.\n\nThe point is that not all change is bad change. In fact, change is necessary to bring about a better future. The transition may be rough at times and it may be hard to see a silver lining in certain tragedies but we may all move forward strongly as individuals and together. We may find a better year in 2021, not because it will be one inherently, but because we can make it a better year. We have taken some punches and we are prepared to deal some of our own. 2021 will not bring a return to normal but perhaps we will start to settle upon a new normal. As the world remains in flux, the next normal is still up for grabs. You can have a better year. We can make a better world."}]}

The video is of an incredible speech by the famous comic and silent actor, Charlie Chaplin. It must have been shocking for those who knew him at the time to hear such powerful words come out of his mouth after so many years spent mostly in silence.\n\nAs I listened to this hope-filled speech again, I found that it stands as true and timely as ever. That is especially impressive considering that the film from which this speech has been clipped was released 80 years ago in 1940.\n\nIf the speech was not already inspiring enough, its pairing with Hans Zimmer's epic score from the movie Inception takes it over the top.\n\nMy favorite line is near the beginning when he says, \"In this world, there is room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful.\"\n\nI encourage everyone to watch the 4 minute speech, and I hope everyone has a nice weekend.\n\n[URL]"}]}

You can know if you are doing what you are supposed to be doing much more easily than whether you are on track for your goal.\n\nAnother reason is that being process-driven has more upside than being goals-driven. When you are working towards a goal, you might well reach it, but you are unlikely to surpass it. However, when you use a goal to develop a process, that process may take you further than any goal you could have possibly imagined, simply by sticking with it past the point where your goal would have already been achieved. \n\nHere's one example I can share from personal experience. A few years ago, I got into long-distance running. I started with a simple process and no goal. The process was to run 5 days per week including 2 short runs, 2 medium runs, and 1 long run. Another part of the process was to add miles each week, especially to lengthen out the long run. I eventually got the long run up to 17 miles and with my 26th birthday coming up I set a goal of running a marathon that day. I accomplished the goal but stopped the process and haven't run more than 10 miles since. Achieving the goal marked the end of the process. If I never set that goal and simply continued with the process, I might have gone a lot further. 26.2 miles is extremely arbitrary.\n\nMost goals are arbitrary. You can go way beyond them. You just have to focus on processes."}]}

As you well know, Tesla has thus far survived strong and continuous opposition from entrenched interests including auto dealerships, incumbent automakers, and big oil.

These cars will win on safety (10x fewer accidents than average drivers), price (5-10x less per mile than Uber), and availability (cars do not sleep). Taxi and Uber drivers will have a common enemy.

I was first opened to the possibility of this being true when my miserable freshman year of college ended up being one of the best things that ever happened ~~to~~ for me. It caused a positive change of course in my life that I cannot imagine having gone without. As a matter of certainty, I didn’t know then and I still don’t know now whether everything truly does happen for a reason. Still, I choose to believe it. If it is true, then I believe something that is true. If it is not, then at least I believe in something that will keep me looking for ways to make things work for me in life. I believe this is a helpful perspective to have and that it can serve a person similarly to how any faith can serve to help people regardless of the object itself or its objective validity.\n\nYesterday I took note of a couple of seemingly unimportant, everyday examples of why this works for me. I should note that in neither case did I so explicitly think, “everything happens for a reason”. Rather, the concept has become a part of who I am and how I look at life. The words are not as important to me as the impact they have had on my general perspective.\n\nThe first example took place at the beach. Lauren and I have spent the last few weeks in Charleston, SC (a beautiful place if you ever have the chance to visit). She took a few days off from work and I front-loaded my week of podcasts so that we could have a nice long weekend. That is how we found ourselves on a beach yesterday afternoon. All good right? An Instagram certainly would have said so. It was ironic that of all settings it was in this one that I let a rare few minutes of frustration come over me. It was a combination of things that caused it. My back has been killing me for no apparent reason and in searching through our beach bag for my sunscreen I was struggling to find it. You know when you are looking for something in a busy bag and desperate times call for desperate measures so you have to take everything out one item at a time only to eventually confirm with certainty that you do not have what you are looking for. That was what happened in this instance. All the while, my back is flaring up and I am realizing that I cannot just relax on the beach because I get burnt faster than bread on a second round in the toaster. I sulked in my chair for a minute feeling like a spoiled shmuck for being so frustrated in the middle of the afternoon on a beautiful day on a beautiful beach on a Thursday. That’s when it occurred to me that I could make something better of the situation than would have been without it. The sensible fix would have been to walk back to the car, drive to the local general store, and buy some sunscreen. That would have cost me some time, money, and energy, but it would have got me to where I wanted to be, or to where I thought I was going in the first place. That was not an intriguing option to me. Instead, I decided to go for a run. I didn’t have compression shorts or sneakers but I didn’t care. I ran 3 miles barefoot on the beach and listened to my last recorded podcast so I could send it back to the guest later for approval. In the process, I shifted my focus, cleared my mind, beat up my feet enough to forget about my back for a bit, and got a good run in. When I got back, I dove in the ocean, floated around for a bit, and I was fine. In fact, I was better than fine. I walked back to my chair and without even thinking about it pulled a towel around my back and over my head like a giant hood. It made enough shade that I didn’t have to worry about getting burnt anymore. I never would have run if not for forgetting the sunscreen. I never would have listened through the podcast. I might not have gone in the water and I certainly wouldn’t have gotten as much color on my arms and legs. I have found that sometimes when I look to make things work for me, I get some added luck from areas that are outside of my control. I could not tell you how I did not get some sunburn through my time running and in the water and shaded by my towel but with my arms and legs exposed. Somehow, I got just enough sun that it wasn’t an issue\n\nThe second example was shorter and sweeter, in a literal sense. Lauren and I drove out at night to get some ice cream for the house from the grocery store. When we arrived, I realized I forgot my wallet which had both of our credit cards in it. All we had in the car was a couple of quarters and a one euro coin for some reason. Neither was enough for a pint. Lauren quickly recalled that she had tried to use Apple Pay last time and that they didn’t have it there. Alternative option #1 was in and out of play before I even thought of it. The fix that first came to my mind was to go in the store and see if I could Venmo someone a few bucks to pay for the ice cream. I didn’t really want to do that but I figured it would probably work and I might have been willing to do it to save ourselves the round-trip of having to go home and come back. Neither of us too much minded the drive so we decided against it and turned around to go home. We were pulling out of the shopping center when I noticed a Ben & Jerry’s. I asked Lauren to pull in so that I could pop out and check if they take Apple Pay. There was a parking spot right in front of the store. I went in. A few minutes later, I walked out with a few pints of better ice cream than anything we could have found at the store. I also learned about a pretty nifty little deal where you can get them to hand-pack a pint of any fresh flavor you want for just 60 cents more than a pre-packed pint and a couple bucks more than a cup. The Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz was an absolute treat and now we have ice cream for weeks!\n\nI know these are not life-shattering examples, but they really do demonstrate the way that believing everything happens for a reason have shifted my perspective in everyday life. Without even thinking of the phrase, I am constantly looking to turn lemons into lemonade. Instead of looking at things as happening to me, I tend to look at things as happening for me. I try to turn obstacles into advantages. Instead of climbing over a wreck in the road, I run around it to find that the new way is often better than the way I was trying to go in the first place. \n\nI will admit, I do not know if this works all the time. I think it is hard to say that there are any golden rules in life. I think believing everything happens for a reason also requires some semblance of sensing when one needs to persist. Hard obstacles are different than soft obstacles and soft obstacles can be dissolved with persistence. Still, there is something to be said for looking at an unanticipated obstacle in the road and realizing that there is always another way to go. Sometimes, the other way can end up being much better than where you intended to go in the first place. Keep your mind open and your eyes peeled. Everything happens for a reason. At least, that’s what I believe."}]}

I found some shows I liked, for sure, but more importantly, I found some people I liked. When I say people, I am not so much talking about podcast hosts. I am talking about the guests.\n\nI frequently listened to several and sometimes more than a dozen podcasts with people who I have now been fortunate to have as guests on my own show. This list includes Balaji Srinivasan, Vitalik Buterin, Keith Rabois, and Aubrey de Grey, just to name a few. I also listened to several podcasts with people who I have not yet had the privilege of hosting on the show. This list includes Peter Thiel, Naval Ravikant, Elon Musk, and Jack Dorsey, again, just to name a few.\n\nEvery person I have listed above is someone I am interested in hearing talk about almost any and every subject they are interested in talking about. While some interviewers and conversationalists may be better than others (there are certainly some who I prefer), I do not very much care who the people I want to listen to are talking to. I just want to listen to and learn from some of the smartest people in the world with whom I share many interests in common.\n\nAs such, whenever anyone asks me what my favorite podcasts are, I list a few of the ones I end up listening to most often, but only after disclosing that that is not actually how I go about listening to podcasts. I typically look for an episode to listen to by searching a guest's name rather than listening to a few shows 90% of the time in what would look like more of a power law distribution. In fact, most of the hosts that I listen to most often are ones I came to like after time and time again finding that I was listening to their show because the guest that I searched for brought me there and I came to be familiar with and fond of the interviewer and his or her style. It is in this way that I come to trust certain hosts and decide to listen to their guests who I am less familiar with once in a while, but this comprises only a small fraction of my overall podcast listening, and there are plenty more ways to discover people you might be interested in listening to podcasts with. I never want to put the entire curation of my podcast listening in the hands of one or a few hosts exclusively. Instead, I want to be able to follow my own interests and go deep into the minds of the people whose perspectives I find most fascinating, and I can only do that by listening to a large variety of different shows.\n\nSo, today's request for startup is fairly simple. I want to be able to use a podcast platform that is structured differently than Apple and Spotify and all the rest. This podcast platform would be somewhat like Twitter in that I would follow certain people and have a feed of podcasts that updates every time one of the people I follow goes on a podcast as a guest. It is a podcast platform organized by guests rather than shows/hosts.\n\nI have a number of ideas around how to make this work but here are a few. The app would have a Twitter import feature so that listeners can instantaneously follow all of the people they follow on Twitter on this new podcasting platform. It would have an internal rating system and an option to sort by rating rather than recency so that listeners can listen to the best of the best of a certain guest and be assured that the ratings are coming from people who listened to the episode for that guest and presumably are rating it less based on whether or not they like the person and more based on how that episode compares to all of the other podcasts they have listened to with that person. The app would have a manual flagging system so that an episode automatically categorized under Elon Musk because it has his name in the title will be quickly removed if it does not in fact feature Elon Musk in the episode but rather a couple of people talking about Elon Musk, his recent rocket launch, or whatever the case may be.\n\nSome people view podcasts as an inferior means of learning versus reading, and while this may or may not be true, what matters to me is not so much which is \"better\" or \"worse\", but what unique benefits each has to offer. I would find it hard to argue that either is entirely \"better\" or \"worse\". It is more useful to think about the advantages of each. Non-fiction reading is great for going deep into a subject, consuming it in an organized manner as the author chose to present it, and highlighting and taking notes, etc., but the benefit of podcasts is that you do not need your favorite people to write a book to be able to learn from them and they can easily do a dozen podcasts a year whereas they may only write a book every dozen years. Most of the people I mentioned in the beginning of this piece have not written books at all. Twitter enabled everyone in the world to follow their favorite people and see what they write about in 280 characters but podcasts have enabled everyone in the world to follow their favorite people and see what they talk about in an hour. The latter is much more interesting than the former to me -- we just don't have an app that makes it easy yet.\n\nMore broadly, I think people are suffering from choice overload and corresponding choice paralysis in a number of areas of media consumption. More than just podcast episodes, there are seemingly infinite songs, TV shows, and movies and I am sure I am not the only one who spends a sad percentage of my time on Netflix or Prime Video picking what to watch versus actually watching it. Perhaps those platforms would be wise to let viewers follow certain actors or directors and see what options are available from that view rather than by somewhat arbitrary category or whatever the Top 10 movies are on Netflix right now.\n\nI know it seems that the podcast universe is becoming crowded, and it is, and that there is a lot of crap, and there is, but I am very confident that the world of podcasting remains in its early infancy as an industry. I think it is an awesome medium of media and I am excited to watch it develop. More than that, I am excited to play a part in its development, and hopefully help drive some of it. For example, I think a ton can be done on the visual side without compromising the quality of the audio which some people may prefer to consume on its own. I have another idea I am even more excited about which relates to podcast monetization and using crypto to enable a better distribution of value to the people who contribute. First and most simply, however, all I want is a simple platform for listening to podcasts where I can follow the people I want to listen to and have a much better feed of episodes that are interesting to me than I am currently able to create by following a bunch of shows.\n\nI am no coder, but this strikes me as a project for which a minimum viable product could be built inside of a week. If you are interested in building it or know someone who might be, please do reach out and let me know. I might be able to help in more ways than you know. As always, you can reach me at jake@blogofjake.com or DM me on Twitter @blogofjake. Have a great week."}]}

I ended up writing a lot about the stock market and the Bitcoin halving. As a result, this post focuses mostly on those topics after a quick blurb about Paris. I also include a few recommendations from my weekend at the end. If you are not interested in the stock market or Bitcoin, even though I tried to write about them in a way that is accessible to everyone, you may like to skip those parts after Paris.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nParis - Lauren and I were supposed to be in Paris this weekend. We booked round-trip flights for $316 in mid-January and were going to see for ourselves whether a Thursday to Sunday long weekend trip to Europe was a reasonable thing to treat ourselves to. It seems that our experiment will have to wait. If and when international travel does return, I recommend Scott's Cheap Flights. The site offers a free email subscription which is constantly offering unreal deals on flights. I cancelled my subscription last month so as not to be consistently teased by temptations of international flights when I know I will not be booking them, but I set a reminder for myself to consider re-subscribing at the end of the year, or else delay the reminder to a later date.\n\nStock Market - Before writing this ahead of the stock market's open this morning, I looked at how the market compared to where it was on the first day of trading this year on January 2nd. Since January 2nd, as of last Friday's close on May 8th, the DOW is down 16%, the S&P is down 10%, and the NASDAQ is actually up but only by less than 1%. This all seems absurd to me. Curious, I looked at the chart for the most recent market-wide fall before this year to help put the current one into context. I focused in on a 3-month period from September 21st, 2018 to December 21st, 2018. In that time, the DOW went down 16%, the S&P went down 18%, and the NASDAQ went down 21%. In other words, the NASDAQ had an incomparably worse time, the S&P was almost twice as bad, and the DOW dropped by the same percentage that is has this year. Do you remember what happened between late September and Christmas 2018 to drive that more significant fall in the market than we have seen thus far this year? Neither do I. I did a brief search to see if I could find anything of note and the biggest factors I could find were \"tariffs driving uncertainty\", \"Fed hikes interest rates\", and \"big tech under scrutiny\". These seem extremely less consequential than the terms that I would attach to the times we are in now which would include \"global economic shutdown\", \"Fed prints trillions\", and \"highest unemployment since The Great Depression\". So, what are the takeaways from this? First, it looks like tech broadly is doing better than the rest of the market this year versus the 3-month fall in 2018 when it was doing worse. This year, the NASDAQ (which is approximately 50% tech) is flat while the S&P (~20% tech) and the DOW (~17% tech) are doing much worse. This is not a novel observation but one that I think is worth making. Second, and more importantly, it seems that one of two things must be true based on the current state of the market. The first thing that may be true is that the stock market is almost entirely detached from the actual economy in terms of the financial well-being of people all over the country, many of whom are unable to pay rent or buy enough food to feed their families after having lost their jobs. The idea that corporate profits (the market) may not be strongly correlated with people's pockets (the economy) seems reasonable to me, but right now the lack of correlation seems to be happening to a drastic degree. The second thing that may be true is that the market has not yet fully fallen from the severity of this global economic crisis which is hiding behind the headline of a global health crisis, not to take away from the tragic number of deaths that the virus has caused. As I wrote in The Virus Is Not Our Only Problem , I fear that the consequences of our response may be worse than those of the virus itself. I believe it is only a matter of time before the stock market will reflect that with a fall more comparable to that of the recent recession rather than a relatively reason-less 3-month dip at the end 2018. I remain mostly on the sidelines holding my two shares of Amazon which I believe are virtually market-proof, a single \"support share\" of both Tesla and Beyond Meat because I believe in them long-term but am not confident in their near-term, and a small number of shares of Twitter for those same reasons. All 3 I could see dragging down, potentially severely, with a broader fall of the market. Lastly, I made small winning bets on DraftKings and Peloton in the last month and am holding small numbers of each which have basically been paid for by my winnings. Some people call this \"playing with house money\" when you are only risking losing what you have already won. For some reason, I have always called it \"playing with monopoly money\".\n\nBitcoin Halving - I would be remiss if I did not comment on the fact that the Bitcoin halving is expected to occur just before 3pm ET this afternoon. It is a significant happening that has occurred only twice since Bitcoin's inception. It happens approximately every 4 years. After it happens, the amount of Bitcoin that is mined (added to the existing owned total of Bitcoins) per block (~10 minutes) will be half of what it was for the last 4 years, for the next 4 years. It will then halve again and the cycle will continue approximately every 4 years until around the year 2140 when it is expected that the last fraction of the 21 million Bitcoins that will ever be mined will be added to the existing owned total. That may be just about the only thing that I can predict with any degree of certainty about the year 2140. It is worth noting that more than 18 million of the ultimate 21 million Bitcoins have already been mined in the first decade or so since the Bitcoin network came into existence on January 3rd, 2009. The first block of bitcoin had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. As I am writing this, each block has a reward of 12.5 Bitcoins. By the time I sit for dinner this evening, each block will have a reward of 6.25 Bitcoins. The nature of the halving fundamentally builds scarcity into the asset. That is why many consider it to be like digital gold. The halving mechanism is a key part of what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. I expect to write more about Bitcoin this week, hopefully tomorrow. Make no mistake, I believe Bitcoin is an extraordinarily excellent investment. That does not mean it is without risk. Far from it. It just means that I believe the risk is very well worth the reward. The amount I have invested in Bitcoin is significantly more than the amount I have invested in all of the stocks that I listed above combined. I have invested more and more only as I have learned more and more about it. If I lost all of my money in Bitcoin, I would be very upset but eventually alright. It is a calculated risk while I am young and can afford to take it for the possibility of the reward, similar to the risk I took quitting my job several months ago. If I did not take these kinds of calculated risks while I was young, I would have a hard time believing that I ever would.\n\nLastly, I will share with you 4 things from my weekend which I highly recommend. These things include a book, a podcast, a song, and a product.

I called it, The 100 Public Experiments Experiment. I added a description as follows:\n\n> Description: This is exactly what it sounds like. I’m going to try 100 public experiments, as an experiment. I’m not going to define what a public experiment is or mandate any criteria, but expect some emergent characteristics may become clear as I do them. I won’t define an objective either. My hypothesis is simply that this is worthwhile.\n\nI added bullets for the first dozen or two that came to mind -- an aggregation of ideas I'd had previously. Then, in the weeks that followed, I added a bullet to the list any time I had an idea that seemed like it belonged. The chapter, Seeds , from Rick Rubin's new book, The Creative Act , provides an excellent description of a similar process. I read that a few weeks after starting my list and could not believe how much it seemed like he was describing what I was doing. But that's not what this post is about, and his chapter is great, so if you want to learn more about this, just go and read that.\n\nWhat you should know is that my list is now 78 bullets long and I have intentionally kept from going through it until today. I have only been adding bullets to the bottom (and perhaps seeing my few most recent bullets by accident, since they're on the screen).\n\nNow, bear with me for a brief detour...\n\n10 days ago, I tweeted this:\n\nAs a result, several people DM'd me. I quickly booked 7 \"Life Advice\" calls for later this month.\n\nThat was the detour. Now, back to the list.\n\nToday, I decided to review my list of experiments from top to bottom for the first time since I started it. I started at the top but didn't get to the bottom. As a matter of fact, I didn't get past the first bullet. I had to go and write this blog post. Why? Because of what the first bullet said:\n\n>   * Life coach calls\n> \n\n\nNow, I know this might be one of those \"had to be there\" or \"had to be me\" moments which is hard to appropriately appreciate since you're not me and you weren't there, but let me try to explain. For more than 2 months, I had intentionally resisted reading this list because I wanted to stay in collection mode before moving on with selection & execution. Little did I know that 10 days ago I started executing on the list, beginning with the very first bullet!\n\nThink about that. 77 bullets and an infinite number of unlisted experiments and the first one that I started on a whim happened to be the very first bullet on the list. I should say, I am not totally surprised that something like \"Life coach calls\" was on the list. Life coaching in general is something I have thought about for a while, just like many of the bullets on this list. But I certainly had no conscious memory of the fact that that was the first item. I was so serendipitously surprised to see it there that I felt compelled to write this. And by now I've realized that this is a bit of a difficult thing to communicate and that those who know what I'm talking about will get it but those who don't probably won't. That's okay. Maybe just trust me on this one and start writing things down.\n\nI am convinced that there exists a mysterious power in writing things down. I don't know exactly how it works or why it works but I do believe that it works. I have experienced it myself, and I have read about it from others who experienced it themselves. Scott Adams wrote about one version of this which he calls affirmations in his worth-reading book, How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. Napoleon Hill and OG Mandino suggest similar practices in their books, Think and Grow Rich and The Greatest Salesman in The World , respectively. The second of those books I first heard about from Matthew McConaughey who I recall had some experience like this himself. I am having a hard time finding the reference from his book but I think he once wrote down that he was going to be an Oscar-winning actor, before he had even started acting, and rediscovered that note many years after writing it, after he had won an Oscar (or something like that).\n\nI like writing things down. Obviously, I have written a lot here on this blog. Writing one page in a morning journal and making frequent use of the Notes app are two of my longest standing habits. I don't have a formula or a step-by-step for you to follow. I am simply suggesting that you write things down more. You may rediscover something you wrote many years after writing it and be as surprised as I was earlier today, which is why I am writing this down."}]}

My predictions that Warren would lose voter share to Sanders, that Buttigieg appeared to be outperforming Biden, and that Bloomberg and Yang should be included on the debate stage have all since come to fruition. Other takes such as that the network should start the debate an hour earlier and that Bernie should announce Tulsi as his running mate have not come true. Well, not yet anyway.\n\nNonetheless, I enjoy following politics despite the frustration that it often produces. I like to consider how I think the future will unfold based on the latest state of play, as I do with most everything that I pay attention to in life. My best prediction of this election thus far came on October 23rd when I predicted by Judge Judy’s seemingly random endorsement that Mike Bloomberg would be a top 3 front-runner for President.\n\nBloomberg officially announced his candidacy a month and a day later on November 24th and he is now widely recognized as a top 2-3 contender with as good a shot to win as anybody.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg's debate last night has been considered an epic failure by virtually everyone I have seen comment on it, from CNN to Fox News and from the general Twitterverse to its most powerful and controversial tweeter, @realDonaldTrump. The words \"crushed\", \"pummeled\", \"disastrous\", and even \"worst in the history of debates\" have been uttered by a host of people who seem to believe that Bloomberg could not have done worse last night. I do not very much like it when everyone agrees and fails to consider an opposite perspective so naturally I am going to take the contrarian view that this debate will in fact serve to help Bloomberg's chances of winning the nomination/presidency. To be clear, I am not arguing that he will necessarily win either (although I do believe he has the best chance of becoming our next president besides Trump) but rather, my argument is simply that last night's debate will prove to be a net positive for Bloomberg, and that it will in fact help his overall chances. This would be evidenced by his forward performance in comparison with current expectations which are broadly that he will fail to win the Democratic nomination, let alone the presidency.\n\nFirst, there is a famous quote that is wrongly attributed to Ghandi which says, \"first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\" That is exactly how it went for Trump. That is sort of how things are going for Bernie, but not nearly as much as it is for Bloomberg. Heading into last night's debate, most of the political experts as well as the results of the first two states that voted (though not necessarily representative of the country) have favored Bernie to win the Democratic nomination, at least in term of having the most total delegates prior to the convention at which point it is most likely that still none of the Democratic Candidates will have a majority to clinch nomination. Despite Bernie being the overwhelmingly clear favorite at this point, the candidates last night either did not believe that or did not at all act like it. As a competitor in a game in which there will be only one winner, it would seem obvious that everyone should fight to take down the leader. That is why it was strange that hardly anyone fought Bernie at all last night, but everyone fought Bloomberg. A far worse outcome for Bloomberg in last night's debate in my opinion would have been if he showed up to his first debate and was a complete non-factor. If all of the other candidates treated Bloomberg like Steyer (no offense to the less wealthy billionaire), I think it would have raised a lot more red flags for Bloomberg's supporters and potential future supporters. Instead, the divided field of candidates which has democrat voters struggling to find a horse they believe in enough to unite behind in a race against Trump decided to attack the horse that has gained surprisingly (to most) strong momentum thus far on a narrative that is more than anything dependent on an argument that he is the most capable of beating Trump in the upcoming election. It seemed to me that the other candidates' apparent fear of Bloomberg which drove them to attack him incomparably more than Bernie, who is literally winning, established Bloomberg as the leader of the field.\n\nSecond, the vast majority of attacks on Bloomberg were focused on two subjects and they were not raised only by the candidates themselves. The moderators' first two questions directed to Bloomberg were about the controversial \"stop and frisk\" program he instituted as Mayor of New York and about the accusations that women have made about certain things that he has said in the workplace. The candidates honed in hard on these issues and basically accused Bloomberg of being a racist and a sexist. His defenses in response to these accusations may not have been strong or even satisfactory according to most, but the accusations themselves were not new and as such I do not envision them changing the opinions of too many people who supported Bloomberg heading into last night's debate or too many people who were and would still be open to moving their support over to his campaign. The attacks on Bloomberg rarely focused on policy or challenged his important and most critical claims that he is the best suited to beat Trump and the most qualified to run the country. If the attacks remain limited to calling him a racist and a sexist, I think there is a group people who have already dismissed him because of those accusations and there is a larger group of people who have not and I do not envision very many people on either side changing their minds in the absence of new and material evidence that paints a worse picture of his character than has already been fairly or unfairly painted.\n\nThird and finally, before last night's debate, Bloomberg's chances of picking up more than exactly zero delegates in the Nevada caucuses this weekend were zero percent, given that he will not be on the ballot until Super Tuesday on March 3rd. Regardless of his performance last night, his chances of picking up a delegate or more in Nevada were always going to be zero, so besides a possible non-results based reversal of momentum, he had nothing to lose between now and next Tuesday's debate which is still a few days before the final primary in South Carolina where he will still be ineligible to win any delegates. The next debate will also be a solid week before Super Tuesday when it will be absolutely critical for him to perform well in aggregate with the 14 states and 1 US territory that will be casting their votes. In high school, someone told me that in the eyes of college admissions offices, applicants who improved their high school grades from low B's to high A's look as if not more impressive compared to those who had high A's the whole way through. Whether this is true or not is not necessarily important, but I do believe that people like to get on board with things that appear to be on an upwards trajectory, whether they are students with improving academics, companies with improving financials, or candidates with improving debate performances. In last night's debate, which has less than half of the days (6) until the next one compared with any other Democratic Debate that has been held or is on the schedule, Bloomberg took the heat, and in the media's mind, he got smoked. The reviews have been brutal, and you can join the masses and view that as a big negative but I see a golden opportunity that would not have been possible without last night's performance. The golden opportunity is for Bloomberg to go out on the debate stage next Tuesday in South Carolina and blow everyone away with a strong and now unexpected performance. If he had 14 points to allocate on these two debates to be rated out of ten, I would have used 5 last night and 9 next Tuesday, and that is what I think he has an amazing opportunity to do if he can pull it off. Bloomberg has been a long shot from the beginning, just like our current president was, but his momentum has grown and grown in the polls and there will be very few if any conducted between this debate and the next one to show a reversal in that momentum, if there in fact has been one. A very strong performance following what was considered a very weak one may be just what this long shot needs to have a real shot to win the nomination and the presidency. One thing is for sure. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out."}]}

I cannot give you a specific reason why I decided to do it. I suppose I realized that I was fasting around 20 hours most days last week somewhat by accident (~16 hours from dinner to lunch is more the standard for me during the week) and I figured I could double that fast without too much difficulty. There is something to be said for going longer or further than you have ever gone before -- whether it be running, walking, fasting or meditating. My longs are a marathon, not sure, 40 hours (soon), and 1 hour respectively, so the second, third, and fourth are all very breakable in the near-term. As for the first, I don't know that I will be running another marathon this year, but I would not put it past myself either.\n\nAnyway, the idea of week-long fasts and meditation retreats have long intrigued me but I have not yet gone for either. This 40-hour fast seemed like an \"easy\" first step. It would break my arbitrary boundary of never having fasted for longer than a day. The hardest part for me was around dinnertime last night but it was not so bad at all and I'm hardly even hungry this morning. I know I could go longer but I believe it is important sometimes to stop when you still have more in the tank. That way, when I go to do a longer fast eventually, I will remember this one as having been relatively easy and can go back and read here that I knew I could go longer at the time.\n\nFor those interested in fasting, here is my introduction to fasting in a tweet:\n\nFor the 40-hour fast, I employed a few more elements. First, I got a group together, just from the people who follow me on Twitter, and the few of us have helped each other over the last few dozen hours with a message here and there. Nothing annoying, just enough to know we are all in it together, an underrated force in any endeavor. My dad ended up joining our merry band of fasters as well, though he stayed out of the groupchat.\n\nThe second thing I did was to take any and all pressure off of myself to do anything other than the fast yesterday. I made it the only thing I needed to do. This was especially easy because the only thing I needed to do was to not do something (eat). Complete inaction would have sufficed. I am fortunate to be in a position where I have enough freedom and control over my time to be able to make that my singular priority for a day. Usually, I have a thing or two I want to get done in a day, but yesterday it was no pressure. Of course, I ended up doing some things anyway and actually had a reasonably productive day, but I made it feel more like a Sunday and less like a Monday. You want to do yourself as many favors as you can when you have something challenging to do. In other words, \"make it easy\". I believe this was the term used in James Clear's book Atomic Habits which reinforced a lot of things I knew and didn't know I knew about habits and also taught me some new things in a much clearer framework than I had ever thought up on my own. Clear is his last name after all.\n\nThe last thing I am going to do is to eat whatever I want once I can in a few hours. This was also noted in Clear's book. You want to give yourself a reward after the thing you want to encourage yourself to do more of. I would like to do more long fasts in the future, and while it may not be as much of a habit as the 16+ hour fasts I tend to do during the week, I want to reflect on my longest fast to date as a positive experience. Last night, I was thinking I would treat myself to an afternoon pizza (not something I would usually eat in the middle of the day on a weekday), but this morning I am realizing almost any food will do. I imagine the sheer phenomenon of taste will be a reward in and of itself. I am not starving, but I am excited to eat.\n\nI think it is good to occasionally remind ourselves of the difference between wants and needs in this world of consistent indulgence where we so often confuse the former for the latter. Just like how when you are sick, the only thing you want is to feel better, when you are fasting for long enough, the only thing you want is to eat. It is good to summon this singular focus once in a while. As much as I try to be appreciative, I inevitably take so much for granted. Deprive yourself of food for a day and you will have no choice but to gain some appreciation for the little things."}]}

It was 45 or 50 degrees with what felt like the strongest sun of the decade so far, that in reference to the new decade into which we are only 8 weeks of course.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nMotorino \\- my favorite pizza in New York if I am ever pressed to give just one. That is much too high of an expectation to take into the restaurant if you do decide to go, but it is what I say. You can expect a Neopolitan Pizza with dough so fundamental that I can only describe it as doughy. It has airy dark bubbles on the crust and just enough char on the bottom from the brick oven in the back. The cheese is quality but the way it melts with the remarkably sweet red sauce to make a pink juice that I would drink out of a cup is what makes it an excellent pizza. While the margherita is the obvious highlight, I also like that they usually bring out a few small circles of salami on the house to get you started, and that my buddy Will and I were able to walk in at prime time on a Friday night and get a table without a wait.\n\nPrimal Fear \\- awesome movie about a lawyer who takes a case defending an altar boy accused of brutally murdering a Chicago priest after being caught literally red-handed (as well as red-clothed and red-faced) running from the scene of the crime. It was Ed Norton's film debut as the accused murderer and he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor as a result of it. Richard Gere as the lead and a who's who cast of women were also great in their respective roles and the movie earned my strong recommendation for anyone who does not mind movies based around a court case or made in the 90's. I always say that 1996 was the best year for movies when I see one, but I say that about 1997 and 1998 too. From that triennium, Good Will Hunting, Swingers, Saving Private Ryan, The Truman Show, and the underrated comedy Liar Liar are five of my favorites.\n\nFrank \\- Italian restaurant with outdoor seating where my buddy Cole and I had a solid brunch on Saturday. Fennel in addition to parmesan seemed unique as an ingredient for an omelette but the combination was unsurprisingly tasty, as are most things with parmesan. A $16 three-for-one drinks option (which I realize would be more like a regularly priced order for three drinks in a less expensive city) gave us no choice but to get three bellinis a piece. The bellini to me is a better version of a mimosa that uses peach puree instead of orange juice. The drink was invented at Harry's in Venice where I was fortunate to try my first one. Harry's was opened by Giuseppe Cipriani whose name you see around New York, most famously in the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal.\n\nPeppi's Cellar \\- a somewhat hidden restaurant bar under the fancier Gran Tivoli restaurant in SoHo where I went with my friends Rob & Chris on Saturday night. I would not go back for dinner but it is a cool spot for drinks. Nothing on the cocktail menu caught my eye so it was mezcal negronis for me.\n\nB&H Dairy \\- went and sat at the counter for a very late Sunday brunch after a very long morning run. Many people dread the idea of eating out alone and I don't do too much of it these days but I used to do it all the time in San Francisco when I was living by myself and didn't know too many people. The thing about eating out alone is that it has as much to do with where you go as anything else. For example, you don't go to a hot bottomless brunch spot on a Sunday afternoon looking for a meal without company. That's a nightmare. You go to a place that is mostly counterspace, off-beat and unpacked like B&H. You can get in and out for $10 including tip if you stick to two eggs & a pound of potatoes with buttered challah on the side, but I got a vegetable juice as well and I want to go back for the soups. Fair warning that it is vegetarian and so if you find yourself in need bacon, B&H is not the move.\n\nMálà Project \\- a Michelin Guide spot for Chinese dry pots at a reasonable price between $15-25 per person. I went with my brother Sunday night and while I wrote in this post how I moved the start of my gluten-free vegan weeks to Monday mornings instead of Sunday nights, this was a place I did not have a desire to go off program. A reasonably accurately named \"mild\" dry pot with wood ear mushrooms, bamboo shoots, firm tofu, and bok choy was fresh, hot, and delicious with a side of white rice. We were able to walk in on Sunday at 7 and it is right around the corner so I am sure we will be back.\n\nOsteria delle Tre Panche \\- even though I went here Tuesday night as a weeknight exception this place must be mentioned as a restaurant from Florence which has been in New York for most of the month of February at Chef's Club NY. I went with friends with whom I had previously been to the restaurant in Florence when we all studied abroad there. Tre Panche means Three Benches and it is named as it is because of the three long benches that comprise the seating area in the restaurant. The temporary New York location was much larger, still fully booked, and a bit over-priced. Still, we got what we went for which was a couple of their mouth-watering truffle dishes for which the restaurant is known. The truffle ravioli, truffle chicken, and truffle mozzarella grilled-cheese-like appetizer were far and away the best dishes on our table where everything was shared. If you are ever in Florence and you like the taste of truffle, go get yourself a bench. It will be worth it.\n\nObviously this was a big foodie weekend for me. I cannot overemphasize how much more enjoyable these weekend meals have been made by the discipline with which I have been intermittent fasting and eating on a gluten-free vegan diet during the weekdays (and doing so very economically as well). Several weeks in now I am still learning and tweaking for improvements but the balance of the system has been great and I do not have any urge whatsoever not to continue with the program. If it is something you would be open to considering, I would highly recommend giving it a one week try."}]}

When you can do what you like, you learn what you like to do. It is good to know what you like to do. It feels great to do what you like.\n\nYou can do anything in a gap year. You can start a business. You can start a blog. You can travel the world. You can live somewhere new. You can run a marathon. You can lose 30 pounds. I know you can do these things and more because I did.\n\nI am happier, healthier, and wealthier than I would have been without a gap year. I am smarter and wiser. I am more positive and grateful. I have a better sense of purpose. I have a better set of habits. I make better decisions. They make me a better person.\n\nOf course, if you are not convinced on the greatness of the gap year, you can always pay full tuition for the opportunity to volunteer in your college’s upcoming online experiment.\n\nIf you are past college like I am, I have one more thing to tell you.

Since then, it has. The public's perspective has shifted accordingly. We now have a couple more months of data as well. I believe that it is now a much smaller problem than most people think. I am more concerned about the consequences of continuing the measures we have implemented to combat it thus far. I fear that those consequences will create much larger problems than most people think. For that reason, I would like to share my current perspective on the problem presented by COVID-19. I will begin by turning the clock back a century.\n\nThis has not killed like the Spanish Flu.\n\nA little over 100 years ago, The Spanish Flu decimated humanity. It killed approximately 50 million people in about two years. That was around 2.8% of the global population at the time.\n\nTo date, COVID-19 has killed approximately 200,000 people in about 2 months. Extrapolating that average death rate over the course of two years would result in 2.4 million deaths worldwide. That would come out to 0.03% of the global population.\n\nIn other words, if the average death rate to date is maintained from now through the end of February 2022, we would reflect on the Spanish Flu as having killed 90 times as many people as COVID-19 as a percentage of the global population in their respective times.\n\nAt this rate, COVID-19 is not killing like the Spanish Flu did. In fact, it is not even remotely close.\n\nIs it possible that COVID-19 could have thus far killed at a much higher and potentially comparable rate in the absence of the actions that most of the world has taken to date in an effort to mitigate it? Sure. I think it is reasonable to suggest that could have been possible. How likely would that have been? I am not sure. I do not believe anyone could be. My intention is not to speculate on what could have been. It is to consider what has been, to put that in perspective, and to take a closer look at the problem. Once we understand the problem, we can better propose a solution.\n\nThis has killed more like car accidents or the seasonal flu.\n\nThe reality of COVID-19 thus far has been nothing like the Spanish Flu in terms of the death rate. It has been more like car accidents or the seasonal flu in that regard. So far this year, COVID-19 has killed half as many people globally as road traffic accidents (437,822) and 33% more people than the seasonal flu (157,813). I am not suggesting that this is anything like the flu, and it is obviously nothing like car accidents, but it is comparable to both in terms of the number of people it has killed this year. It is important to put the number of COVID-19 deaths in perspective. It allows us to observe how little attention we pay to comparable killers and contrast that against how much we are sacrificing to prevent incremental deaths from COVID-19.\n\nSide note: please resist the urge to discredit this analysis by using the easy out that I must be dumb or ignorant because I am comparing this to the flu. I am only comparing it in terms of the total number of deaths so far this year, and as such, the average rate at which it has killed. I am well aware that the basic reproduction number (R0), which can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case, seems to be significantly higher without intervention (social distancing and alike). I am also aware that the case fatality rate (CFR), or the percentage of cases that result in death, also seems to be significantly higher, though our ability to accurately estimate it has been compromised by a global lack of testing. For a bit of color on that lack of testing, it is worth noting that the 10 countries with the most COVID-19 deaths (excluding China due to lack of numbers) have administered between1 and 29 tests for every 1,000 citizens (the US figure is 17). A disproportionate number of these tests go to severe cases versus mild ones and people who are asymptomatic. Since severe cases have the highest death rate, we know that the rate suggested by dividing total deaths over total confirmed cases is overstated to some degree. The problem is that we have very little idea about exactly how overstated it is.\n\nIt is time to shift from panic mode to manage mode.\n\nWe now know that what we have done to mitigate the spread of the virus has worked. Most hospitals seem to have cooled from their recent peaks. We flattened the curve to the point where it did not overwhelm our hospital systems in the US like it did in Italy. Our response in panic mode likely saved us from that type of scenario and from many more COVID-19 deaths as a result. That said, the consequences of what we have done and continue to do could lead to other deaths and a lot of suffering. The time has come for us to switch from panic mode to manage mode.\n\nWe can afford to open things up in a sensible manner. We can monitor the rate of people entering hospitals with COVID-19. We can manage this evolving crisis one day at a time. If we need to shut certain areas down again, we can. I believe we can do it better too. Either way, we need to start turning the lights on again.\n\nI am disappointed to see places like San Francisco extending the stay at home order for another month. Their leadership seems to be operating with an impractical objective of getting COVID deaths as low as possible. That is a fine objective in panic mode when the issue seems exponential and out of control, but that is no longer the case. Unlike several weeks ago, we have now established measures by which we can mitigate this virus. We have established some semblance of control. It is no longer the same blind threat that it once was. This virus will not be entirely extinguishable without impenetrable borders and perfect adherence to quarantined isolation inside of those borders. That is not a feasible approach in the US. For what it is worth, I would be fine to do that myself, but I suspect most people would not. Since the approach is not feasible, neither is the objective.\n\nThe objective should not be to drive the number of infected as low as possible. It should be to manage the crisis as effectively as possible to limit the damage on all sides of the equation. We of course want to keep the number of COVID-19 deaths in check, but we also want to limit the unknown consequences of our actions in doing so. Determining the maximum average rate of COVID-19 deaths that should be considered “in check” is a difficult task. It is impossible to justify an exactly “right” number. There are far too many unknowns. Still, it seems to me that keeping the death rate under that of car accidents is too low a level to require on one side of the equation when the consequences on the other side are unknown and seem poised to potentially be more punishing in the long run and extremely difficult to resolve.\n\nAs it stands, we continue to risk these unknown consequences in exchange for incremental improvements against a single issue which has gained disproportionate attention. So far, we know unemployment has surged to the highest levels since The Great Depression and we know that food banks are seeing skyrocketing demand. We do not know all of the long-term impacts that the measures we have taken will have on suicide rates, domestic violence, poverty, starvation, homelessness, and more. We need to start mitigating the unknown and potentially brutal consequences of our unprecedented actions while sacrificing known consequences in the short-term at an acceptable level. We cannot afford to pretend every life saved from COVID-19 is invaluable when the fact of the matter is that there are many more lives lost every day by preventable problems that we can fix less consequentially but are simply not paying as much attention to.\n\nThis is a New York / New Jersey Problem.\n\nNow that we put the problem in perspective, let us address its most obvious particulars. New York and New Jersey have 83 counties in total. A combination of New York City and only 6 of these counties has accounted for almost exactly one third of all US deaths from COVID-19 (32.93%). The combined population of New York City plus Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Bergen, Essex, and Hudson counties is 14.6 million people. That is 4.45% of the US population which is accounting for one-third of all deaths. That means 95.55% of the US population is accounting for the other two-thirds. In terms of deaths per capita, this has been 10x more deadly in New York City and the other 6 NY/NJ counties than it has been in the rest of the country. It has killed more than 1,200 people per 1,000,000 in these specific NY/NJ areas while killing only 120 people per 1,000,000 in the rest of the US. We should be treating it accordingly.\n\nIt is unwise for us to have a relatively uniform response nation-wide or even state-wide. Tennessee is not the same as New York. The other 70+ counties of New York and New Jersey are not the same as their much more severely infected neighbors. We need to see these differences more clearly.\n\nThis is an Older People / Comorbidities Problem.\n\nThe median age in New York State is 38.2 years old. That means about half of all people in New York are 39 and under while the other half is 40 and older. In New York thus far, less than 2% of all COVID deaths have been from the younger half while more than 98% have been from the older half. Let us leave aside for now the fact that the older half can and should be broken down further since a healthy 40, 50, or 60-year-old is almost incomparably less likely to die versus a 70-year-old diabetic. For starters, it is useful enough to establish the fact that one half of the population is dying at 49 times the rate of the other half.\n\nFrom that starting point, we can take the large portion of healthy people from the older side and move them to the younger side. We can then take the small portion of young people with hypertension, diabetes, cancer or other comorbidities and move them to the older side. Once we separate the most at-risk population from the rest, I suspect we might end up with something like 90% of the population that is young and/or without comorbidity accounting for just 1% of all deaths. That would leave 10% of the population that is old and/or with comorbidity accounting for 99% of all deaths.\n\nWhile these estimates are only speculative, I cannot imagine they are very far off. We need to drill down on the best data available, determine the most reasonable criteria by which we can separate the smaller most at-risk population from the rest, and treat these different populations accordingly.\n\nConclusion.\n\nCOVID-19 has not killed like the Spanish flu. It has killed more like the seasonal flu or car accidents. The time has come to shift from panic mode to manage mode. We have to realize this has been a totally different problem for people who are older and/or have comorbidities than it has been for people who are younger and/or do not. In the US, we have to realize this has been a totally different problem in a few parts of New York and New Jersey than it has been in most of the rest of those states and most of the rest of the country.\n\nIn writing this, I relied on some numbers that I am assuming are mostly valid. I have linked to the sources for these numbers in the body of the text. I am also assuming that there are no significant long-term impacts for those who are infected but recover from COVID-19 as that could materially change my perspective on the matter. There are certain things I do not think should be re-opened such as offices that can operate remotely without significant consequence and schools that can do the same. We should continue using masks, gloves, washing our hands, not touching our faces, and being respectful and responsible in public. I personally will not be going out much in the beginning once restrictions are lifted, whenever that is. I am fortunate not to need to do so in order to maintain the satisfaction of my fundamental needs. I will continue to try to support people and small businesses without going out and potentially contributing to the spread unknowingly. My perspective as far as I know is not driven by any selfish desires to get \"back to normal\". I stand by what I wrote previously. There is no going back. These are just my opinions. I have a number of thoughts regarding solutions that I look forward to hopefully sharing another day. If anyone has any respectful critiques of my perspective, I would genuinely enjoy getting to consider them. As always, please send any questions or comments to jake@blogofjake.com or feel free to comment on Twitter @blogofjake. As always, my opinions are subject to change. This is where I stand today."}]}

We have found that around the six or seven week mark it has become more difficult to keep count. If it had not already, this quarantine period seems now to have earned itself recognition as its own chapter. It looks like it will be over soon, this first chapter of an unfamiliar and unpredictable era at least. I am optimistic that it will be for the best that we begin to go on offense now for a bit.\n\nBill Gates predicted this pandemic five years ago in a TED Talk called \"The next outbreak? We're not ready.\" He seems like one of the better combinations of smarts, good intentions and the power of money and influence that we have in this world. I imagine we will be following his lead more than ever now that he has stepped down from the board of Microsoft and is focusing the attention of his foundation exclusively on this pandemic for the foreseeable future. The man who has been the richest in the world for most of my lifetime once famously said, “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.” In the face of this global crisis, we must be urgent, yes, but also patient. The world may not emerge from this as quickly as most of us would like it to, but when it does, it may be stronger than most of us could have imagined.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nGrilled Fries - It was another nice weekend of \"anything goes\" eating after another successful week on the \"hardly anything goes\" program. I tried my hand at making french fries Friday night to compliment the burgers that my brother cooked up nicely on the grill. I cut two large potatoes precisely into fine and skinny slivers that I hoped would come out crispy once cooked. Next, I added four tablespooons of olive oil with an extra drizzle at the end for good measure. I thin-sliced two cloves of garlic from a fresh bulb while pretending I was Paul from Goodfellas like I do every time I slice garlic. Finally, I added a healthy amount of salt and pepper and a little onion powder before dumping them on some tin foil on the grill. Next time I would cook them in the oven to maintain the separation of fries and increase overall crispiness, but the grilled fries were mighty tasty nonetheless.\n\nElon on AI - I listened to a great podcast during my run on Saturday. Elon Musk was the guest on a show called Artificial Intelligence with Lex Fridman. When people ask me for podcast recommendations, I generally point to these Monday posts which do a better job recollecting some good ones than my momentary memory does on its own. I also tell them that I find great episodes just as often by searching for people I want to hear speak as I do by depending on specific shows that I have saved. That was how I found this one on Saturday. I simply searched to find a podcast with Elon Musk. I am honestly blown away by his intelligence every time I hear him speak. In just 30 minutes on Saturday, he changed my perspective on Tesla, the human brain, and Earth itself. I expect to write more on these subjects soon.\n\nAtomic Habits \\- At the recommendation of my buddy, McNulty, I started reading a book called Atomic Habits this weekend. It is about building small habits that can have large impacts. McNulty's recommendation was serendipitous as I had coincidentally discovered the book and its author, James Clear, on Twitter the day prior. I am a little less than 100 pages into it and since I am all about habits I am finding it to be as interesting as any book I have read in the last few months. Granted, I have not read very many books this year. The truth is, I have never been an avid reader of books. One thing I am doing now in an effort to try to change that is to read without taking any notes, highlighting, underlining, or anything of the sort. My new approach stems from one of two good tips I learned from Naval Ravikant on reading. The first was to read what you love until you love to read. The second was specifically not to read for the purpose of learning, but rather, to simply read for the purpose of reading. Growing up, I rarely ever read books that were assigned for school or otherwise because the reading that was assigned was so significant and most of the books were not particularly interesting to me. Once I figured out I could succeed in class simply by following along with the discussion, I had no incentive to read books. Listening to and considering different people's different perspectives on something was generally more interesting to me than the thing itself anyway. I did not like having to read and I did not need to read to succeed, so I didn't. For some time now, I have been hoping to change that. I have read some books in the last three years, but I hope and believe that I have many more ahead. Now I am reading books I want to read because I want to read them, not because I have to. I have intentionally abandoned any efforts to retain information for the purpose of learning. Instead, I am trusting the process. I am reading to read.\n\nSunday Run - I figure it cannot hurt to end this edition of The Weekend Miscellaneous with something slightly uncomfortable that some people might find funny at my expense. Yesterday, I ran for a little over an hour in an old cotton t-shirt outside in the pouring rain. When I got home and took my shirt off to get in the shower, I noticed a bit of pain and couple of unfamiliar stains. Sure enough, I looked down and found my nipples were bleeding. Avoid this if you can. It was as unfamiliar a site as it was unpleasant a sensation. Sufficed to say, I have learned my lesson about running in a cotton t-shirt in the rain."}]}

I initially picked it up to re-read my favorite chapter, Seeds.\n\nThere were five underlined parts across two chapters that I wanted to share here – for myself to remember, and for you to read – because they ring true to my experience in life so far. Here they are:\n\n“You learn to trust yourself – in the universe, with the universe, as a unique channel to a higher wisdom.”\n\n“trust in the process”\n\n“This isn’t a matter of blind belief in yourself. It’s a matter of experimental faith.”\n\n“Faith is rewarded, perhaps even more than talent or ability.”\n\n“Over time, as you complete more projects, this faith in experimentation grows.

Since then, Amazon shares are up over 27% versus the S&P 500 which is up just over 6%. I stand by everything that I wrote in that post and encourage you to read it again. The fact that the investment has done well in this short period of time does not matter as much as the added conviction I continue to gain in my logic and general perspective as an investor.\n\nIn that same post, I quoted a previous one from February 27th. That was my first post on the Coronavirus. In it, I wrote that I had sold all of my stocks on February 24th (the Monday prior). That was right before the market crash which has now largely recovered, but which from my perspective, is far from finding a bottom in terms of both prices and time. It is interesting to go back and read the rest of that post as well.\n\nOne of my favorite parts about writing on this blog for you all to read is that it serves as a means by which I can be held accountable. I have not ever deleted or edited a post other than to correct a simple typo. I do not expect that I ever will. Because this is written in stone, I expose myself to the possibility of making brutally bad predictions and having people easily able to call me out on them. At the same time, if I can continue to develop a keen understanding of the world around me in a way that enables me to make good predictions and give good advice, many posts will age nicely. I hope to write many more posts that age well than those that age poorly. Only time will tell, and as much as I or anyone else, you will be the judge."}]}

For those who are not, you can think of it as Chipotle for salads, though that comparison loses its validity as you come to understand the nuances of the brand. I had a salad from Sweetgreen yesterday and the place was absolutely packed, even at an off hour. That has prompted me to share a few short paragraphs that I have previously written on this company which I believe will continue to grow very successfully.\n\nI have enjoyed being a Sweetgreen customer for more than two years now. While the brand has already garnered a lot of attention and a $1.6B valuation, I believe it has a much larger and brighter future ahead if it continues to execute so well on its mission. When you compare Sweetgreen to Chipotle (~15x SG’s valuation) or McDonald’s (~100x SG’s valuation), it becomes clear that if Sweetgreen can truly become the direct-to-consumer food platform of the modern day generation, the upside is far greater than its current valuation. \n\nThe brand’s focus on sustainability, local sourcing, and animal welfare aligns squarely with the food-related issues that people today care about most and that they will continue to care about in years ahead. The direct-to-consumer approach initiated by the popular Sweetgreen app (which I understand processes about half of total orders) and expanded by the recent launch of Sweetgreen outpost is a strategy that has proven across various categories to resonate well with today’s consumers. \n\nSweetgreen is building that direct relationship with its customers based on trust (using blockchain, the latest innovation in the concept of trust itself, to facilitate the traceability of ingredients), meeting customers where they are, and personalizing their food experiences based on where they live, which season it is, and what they like to eat. Interestingly, I heard one of the founders make the analogy that as books are to Amazon, salads will be to Sweetgreen. He believes and I agree that it has the potential to provide people with several meals a week, and I have already seen this come to fruition. \n\nOne of my best friends from my old office in San Francisco once went an entire month eating only Sweetgreen for lunches and dinners. I myself frequently went and got both dinner and lunch for the next day, multiple times per week. In summary, I am excited by Sweetgreen because I believe it is poised to become an extremely successful food brand and potentially a ubiquitous food platform built upon the values of modern consumers. For a growing number of them, I believe Sweetgreen will become more than just an occasional choice among many options, but rather, the default choice with many of their personal favorite options."}]}

Nobody cares about this sentence. Nor this one. Nobody really cares much about most things. Some people don't really care about anything.\n\nI am sorry to tell you, but very few people care about you. Don't take that personally. It's the same for me. If you are lucky, some people do care about you. But none of them think about you as much as you think about you. A few of them may think about you a lot. And a few of them may care about you a lot. One, two, or a few might even be willing to sacrifice their life for you. But again, you are lucky to have a few.\n\nMeanwhile, you are you. All the time. You think about you. Not all the time, but a lot. You can never get away from you. You are naturally biased by your own point of view. You think people think about you because you think about you because you are you, but no one really cares.\n\nNow, let me be clear. \"Nobody cares\" is not meant to be taken literally. Nor is it meant to be taken negatively. For me, it is a useful hyperbole. It reminds me I'm free.\n\nHere is how the logic goes:\n\nNobody cares what I write. So I might as well write what I like.\n\nNobody cares what I do. So I might as well do what I want to.\n\nNobody cares who I am. So I might as well be me.\n\nA lot of people spend a lot of time and energy acting like they're someone they're not. They won't do what they want to do because they are worried about what others might think. The freeing truth is that they won't think anything at all. Nobody cares.\n\nWell, roughly."}]}

You can learn more at Outlier.org\n\nOutlier is essentially MasterClass for credit transferable college courses. In fact, the company's Founder & CEO, Aaron Rasmussen, was one of the co-founders of MasterClass (I have some thoughts on MasterClass that I will share in a future post). The content and production quality unsurprisingly appears the same and that alone bodes well for the company.\n\nI discovered Outlier by the news that it just raised $11.7 million in Series A funding. For the time being, it offers only two courses - Intro to Psychology and Calculus 1. Unless colleges have changed a lot in the last few years, I imagine a lot of students would consider any alternative to the Calculus 1 class that is offered by their school.\n\nIt looks like the courses have multiple teachers for each subject with different approaches to match different learning styles. I would be curious to hear from students who took these classes in the Fall 2019 semester. My guess is that these classes are relatively well liked and that most students found them effective to at least a satisfactory degree.\n\nAs important as the fact that these classes earn students real transferable credits is the fact that they are only $400 per class, including textbooks. If you do the math assuming 5 courses per semester for 8 semesters gets a student to graduation, then a student hypothetically could one day get a full college education from Outlier at its current price per course for a total cost of $16,000. Compare that with the chart below from US News and keep in mind that those averages in the chart need to be multiplied by 4 to make them apples to apples with the $16,000 figure quoted above, assuming a 4 year path to graduation.\n\nCollege education in the United States is obviously over-priced. Everybody knows this as a widely accepted fact but the chart below should make it evidently objective for anyone who still has any doubt.\n\nMaybe Outlier will be the first online program to crack the code on providing a successful alternative of scale for college education. Maybe not. Either way, I am glad to see a well-funded venture with strong leadership and a seemingly sound business plan attacking this problem that is well overdue for a fix."}]}

For most of my life, I did not have one at all. At least, nothing conscious or intentional beyond showering, getting dressed, and having breakfast before school. Even the shower and breakfast parts became optional in college, especially before the days when I had an early morning statistics class.\n\nThings changed when I started working full-time in San Francisco during the summer of 2017. I became more conscious and intentional about my morning routine. I have still had many months since then without any morning routine, and I typically do not practice the same routine on weekends, but for the majority of the time over the last two and a half years, I have had at least one morning practice beyond general human hygiene that in my book qualifies as a morning routine. Below is the morning routine that I am beginning with in 2020:\n\n1\\. Wake up, get out of bed, turn off phone alarm across the room\n\n2\\. Breathing exercise (4/7/8 second inhale/hold/exhale x 10 reps)\n\n3\\. Chug a large bottle of water\n\n4\\. Shower and brush teeth\n\n5\\. Back stretches (5 minutes)\n\n6\\. Journal (1 page or 2-3 minutes, be overly positive and grateful)\n\n7\\. Vitamin Drink\n\n8\\. Blog\n\n9\\. Breakfast (Green Smoothie)\n\nThis whole routine (excluding the blog) should not take any longer than about 30 minutes without distraction. The blog can take longer than everything else combined depending on the post and so for that reason some days I will skip it to write later in the day. Everything else is relatively quick and easy and I believe each item adds to the sum of a great way to start the day.\n\nThis is the most extensive morning routine I have tried in terms of the number of items, and it includes most of the individual morning practices that I have tried to date. Others that I have tried include cold showers in the summer, meditation, working out / running, and walking (usually to work as the last step of the routine). The 2 or 3 minute positivity / gratitude journal has been the stickiest practice for me and while I have taken multi-month breaks I have probably journaled on about 75% of weekdays over the last two and half years. In future posts, I will likely explain my rationale for the inclusion of some of these practices above, and describe them in greater detail to the extent that may be helpful as well. I have found that a key to maintaining the routine is to not beat myself up when I miss days, and to give myself periods of time without any routine at all. I encourage you to follow the simple mantra I got from a venture capitalist named Brad Feld who I was fortunate to connect with several months ago through one of my cold emails. When you miss a day or lose the habit of your routine, “Simply begin again.”"}]}

That said, compared to the average person, I believe my current perspective on the matter is relatively well developed. That is why I have decided to share it today.\n\nMy goal in this instance is not to make specific predictions, but rather, to share my best guess expectations based on the aggregate of the information I have read, and in the end, to suggest simple actions we all can take to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.\n\nThe three variables that I believe are most important to forecast are the number of people who will be infected by the coronavirus and the percentages of those people who will (a.) develop severe cases of it, and (b.) die as a result of it.\n\nMy understanding is that the traditional flu typically infects about 10% of the population with a death rate of 0.1% among those infected. Therefore, 0.01% of the total population are expected to die from the flu each year. This is still a lot but we usually take basic precautions to prevent ourselves from spreading it if we have it (not going to work, taking tamiflu, washing hands) or from getting it if we don’t (getting flu shots, washing hands). Healthcare systems do their best to treat those with more severe cases who need to be treated, and generally they have the resources to do so, here in America at least.\n\nCompared with the traditional flu, many of the people who seem to me to be well informed on the novel and still very difficult to predict coronavirus believe that it will infect between 25-75% of the population, with a death rate between 1-2%. The size of these ranges as much as anything else should serve to show how unpredictable this whole situation remains at this stage. The third number is not as important with the traditional flu but matters in this instance because of the potentially 7x greater number of people who could be infected with the coronavirus versus the flu (up to 75% vs. ~10%). That number is the percentage of people who will develop severe cases. This number I have seen projected at around 10x the death rate, so between 10-20%. It matters because if this number holds at a scale that ends up being on the higher end of the projected infected rate then the death rate could theoretically increase as a percentage of the severe case rate due to healthcare systems not having the resources (human and otherwise) to even attempt to treat, let alone effectively treat, all of the severe case patients in need. Ignoring this issue and taking only into consideration the currently projected infection and death rates that I mentioned earlier in this paragraph, the overall death rate in the population would project to be in a range that is between 25-150x that of the traditional flu at between 0.25% and 1.5% of the population (versus 0.01%). In the worst case based on these assumptions, up to 15% of the population would have severe cases in need of treatment (20% severe of 75% infected). It bears repeating that this is the absolute worst case based on the current wide-range projections that I have seen. Still, by those best guess projections it is a feasible case nonetheless and so without being too much of an alarmist I do believe it is useful to consider for the purpose that I previously stated of preparing for the worst while hoping for the best.\n\nThe measures that I have taken thus far have been easy and low effort. Beyond trying to spend a few minutes per day getting informed, I have made an effort to wash my hands more, trade hand shakes and daps for fist pounds (I do this a lot anyway), and from a less important than physical health, financial health perspective, I sold all of my stocks on the market’s open on Monday because I do unfortunately think that the panic if not the reality of the situation will get worse before it gets better. Hopefully I will be wrong, but I would rather be wrong and miss out on whatever market fluctuations may occur between now and when it all blows over than to keep my money in the market for the ride, especially when people have predicted a significant downturn that has yet to come every year for the last few years. This is a good time to mention that I am not a doctor nor a wealth manager, just a person sharing a few precautions that I have taken. As things progress and if cases start to percolate throughout New York City, I might become more inclined for however long the spread persists to spend less time with fewer people and possibly go home to New Jersey (by car, not by NJ Transit through Penn Station). I would also consider stocking up on 2-3 weeks worth of essentials (as I read recommended), being sure to buy things without near-term expiration dates which I would go through eventually anyway, again, just in case of a worst case scenario.\n\nI will close by saying that I do not believe in the utility of a state of panic at either the individual or collective level. I do not intend with my writing today to cause anyone to enter such a state. My only intention is to share what I have come to believe based on what I have read to date from sources most of which I had never heard of prior to this outbreak but which I have chosen to give varying amounts of trust based on their large followings, titles of authority, and as important as either of those things, the soundness of their logic and reasoning from my perspective. I of course hope that the coronavirus does not become the potential pandemic that a lot of people are predicting it will be. Best case scenario, a lot of people spend a lot of time and energy preparing for something that will not be nearly as bad as many expect it to be. Even then, our over-preparation might be useful in helping to make it an even smaller situation than it otherwise might have been.

I tend to enjoy commencement speeches and have watched several on YouTube from the likes of Jobs and Bezos to David Foster Wallace and Will Ferrell. I recommend all four of those but none moreso than Steve Jobs’ address at Stanford. Two of the three parts that I recall most often are about the dots and the mirror. The third is when he says, “remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.” I have also had the back cover of The Last Whole Earth Catalog as my iPhone’s lock screen background since college. You will know what that says if you listen to the speech.\n\nWhile Steve Jobs had his own set of flaws like anyone else, I have taken a lot of wisdom from the things that he had to say and the things that others had to say about him in books and otherwise. I hope you will take the 15 minutes or so to watch or listen to his speech here."}]}

The reason I do not want to create them myself is not because I think they are bad. It is because I appreciate the intensity and duration of effort that goes into building a successful startup, and I am not going commit myself to doing that until I know I absolutely have to. So long as I am not going to build these products myself, the next best thing I can do is to share the ideas so that others may steal them. Perhaps I might have the ability to advise these people along the way and eventually invest once I have more money and am able to do so. By this logic, I may begin more frequently posting some ideas on the blog with titles as exemplified by this post beginning with the phrase, \"Request for Startup:\".\n\nToday, I would like to put out a request for a harmless vape, like a JUUL but without the crippling addiction to nicotine that comes with it. Some products related to this idea do exist from oxygen inhalers to aromatherapy vaporizers, the latter of which I have tried, but I am somewhat unsatisfied with the existing options. I am glad these products exist and they are better than nothing but they are not popular like JUUL or like smoking cigarettes and that is primarily because they are not cool. Perhaps it is true that a product like this simply can't be cool and never will be, but I am not so sure.\n\nThe reason I want this idea to exist is because I would use it and because I believe others would too. There is a pleasure in smoking that those who have never tried it may not appreciate, but I think it comes as much from the act of smoking itself as from the actual substance being smoked. That is not to say that the substance has no impact on the experience (of course it does), but I think if someone can create something potent enough to create a nice head-rush or occasionally a fleeting sense of euphoria from an at least harmless or at best beneficial vapor, people would dig it. The problem with the existing options is again that they do not feel like they do much and they aren't particularly cool.\n\nIt bears repeating, my idea rests on the assumption that the sensation of smoking is not just about the substance itself. It is about sitting outside a café or on a park bench or even just on the side of the street, enjoying a low effort and somewhat sensational activity so that you may let your attention wander to the things in your surroundings as you do it.\n\nConsider Georges Seurat's famous painting,A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte , pictured below.\n\nNo one is smoking but you could imagine they could be. In a world where we have infinite \"entertainment\" on our phones, it has quickly become unusual to see someone simply standing or simply sitting, just thinking or observing the world around them as in the painting above. Today it looks quite odd to be sitting on a park bench without looking down at your phone or at least listening to something through your headphones.\n\nWho looks like he might be a weirdo? The guy on his phone or the guy behind him?\n\nThis morning, I was on a walk and took a break to lean against a guardrail on the side of the street. I noticed a wave of self-consciousness come over me as a car drove by. \"What could he possibly be doing? Is there something wrong with him?\" All I was doing was sitting there, like the people in the painting, listening to a stream, not of music through my headphones, but of water flowing behind me, and to the birds chirping from branches above. I saw the snow all around me and watched two deer venturing through the woods. I enjoyed the cold winter air and watched the steam of my breath as I exhaled. I realized, had I been smoking, I might not have looked as unusual, but rather cool.\n\nIt would be a tall order to request that we rewire the cultural consciousness to see someone doing nothing out in public and think of them not as unusual but as cool. The easier thing to do is to give people something innocent to do so that they may not feel hesitant to go sit in the sun for an hour. Perhaps a harmless vaporizer could allow people to do such a thing more comfortably, and could prevent others still from picking up a cigarette or a JUUL instead. This isn't the most revolutionary idea and I feel somewhat silly making it my first explicit request for a startup, but the fact of the matter is that I would like to see a better product of this kind than is currently available to me. Perhaps something about this idea resonates with you. Perhaps you can make it happen."}]}

In today’s world, many people (myself included) are so focused on self-improvement and general optimization that anything not oriented towards some sort of productivity can feel like a waste of time. I believe it is important to overcome this negative consequence of the otherwise positive growth mindset by recognizing the true value of down time, especially spent with the people you love and care about. Sometimes the things we like to do with these people can be as ordinary and unproductive as a Sunday on the couch with a solid spread of food on the table and football on the television, and that is totally fine. Better than fine, to me, that is great.\n\nIn honor of the tradition, a quick point on football and a quicker one on 60 Minutes.\n\nThis past week, 49ers radio analyst Tim Ryan was suspended a week from work for describing how good Lamar Jackson is at faking the handoff as follows:\n\n“He’s really good at that fake, Lamar Jackson, but when you consider his dark skin color with a dark football with a dark uniform, you could not see that thing,”\n\nI do not view this as an offensive thing to say at all. It seems to me to be a factual statement. Richard Sherman and Dee Ford on the 49ers as well as many others have since come to Tim’s defense, but it is a shame to me that I and many others who now know Tim Ryan know him only as the guy who got suspended for saying a thing that some people said was racist.\n\nThis was a good example of what Obama aptly dubbed the “woke call out culture” on social media resulting in an organization taking punitive measures against someone to avoid being associated with whatever accusation the call out culture is calling out.\n\nUnfortunately, the media cycle on the subject did not end there. Yesterday, Lamar wore long white sleeves and a white glove with his white jersey and so naturally Yahoo! (one of the top 5 most popular websites in the US along with Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon as of 2017) had on its homepage an article about whether Lamar did this as a “dig at [the] ‘dark skin’ controversy”, without any substantiative evidence. In fact, asked after the game why he wore the sleeves and why he took them off at half, Lamar basically said, because it was cold, and then because he got warm. This to me highlights the silliness of the whole thing.\n\nI do hope the popular news sites get better or the better news sites get popular but I am skeptical that either will happen in the near term because the ones on top are profit-driven entities with strong network effects.\n\nOn the subject of better news, 60 Minutes was worth a watch last night. It featured George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School who is working on, among other things, reversing aging. Research on anti-aging strategies and efforts to extend the human healthspan represent one of the most fascinating areas of work currently ongoing from my perspective. I was introduced to this science by Laura Deming who is doing some inspiring work through The Longevity Fund and AGE1 out in San Francisco. I will post more extensively on this subject in the future.\n\nHappy Monday."}]}

I first discovered the title earlier this year when I stumbled upon its soundtrack on Spotify. I limited myself from listening beyond a few songs before watching. Now that I have seen it, I can confidently say it is one of my 5 or 10 favorite soundtracks I have heard in a movie, no exaggeration. Convinced by the music alone, I was looking forward to watching the movie once it became available for streaming. By the time it did, I had forgotten about it. I finally got to watching it last night. I highly recommend it. Had the film released this month instead of last November, I would not have been surprised to see it nominated for movie of the year. I do not mean to overhype it. In my opinion, a movie of the year level is far too high an expectation to set ahead of any viewing. That said, I have often seen only decent movies elevated to award status for their timeliness alone. If any of those movies qualified for such a premium, this fine film certainly does too. It raises a number of questions about what should and should not have happened in the story. I will share my brief perspective only partially on the latter.\n\nIn the beginning scene, the girl should not have made certain comments. The cop should not have pulled out his gun. The cop should not have shot the girl - it never should have gotten to that point. The cop should not have been shot - it never should have gotten near that point. Including the rest of the movie, anyone who was killed should not have been killed. I will not comment beyond that or beyond the confines of the movie in regards to racism. I do expect to share something at some point and it is probably not going to be a perspective you have read before. For now, I will simply end by stating that this movie deserves much more attention than it has received thus far. It is very well done, directly on point, and unquestionably worth the watch. I rate it an 8.1 out of 10."}]}

I discovered this quote in a book called Daily Rituals by Mason Currey. The book explores the daily routines of approximately 200 of the greatest creative minds of the last few centuries. Pyotr was just one of countless examples such as Darwin, Beethoven and Kierkegaard whose daily routine depended in some fashion on the habit of walking. In fact, besides my shock at how much smoking, coffee, alcohol, and to a lesser degree, amphetamines, were behind many of these creatives' brilliant work, I was most surprised to find that walking was the number one consistency I found amongst them. That is not to say that everyone included walking in the divulgence of their daily routines, but many and maybe even most of them did, and many of those who did walked significant distances indeed.\n\nThis is not the first time that it has dawned on me that walking may be a secret superpower of sorts to the well-lived life and more manageably the well-done day. I was first turned onto walking during my junior year of college while studying abroad in Florence and each morning walking out our apartment door, passing the Mercado Centrale, and then the Duomo, and finally taking a bridge parallel to the Ponte Vecchio to get to the main school building. I reckon it was about a 15 or 20 minute walk, and if there was any way to get introduced to walking, that would have been it, hungover as death, crossing maybe the most beautiful city in the world, with the Florentine smell of fresh pastries and espressos in the air.\n\nThe habit of walking each morning and throughout the day stuck with me when I returned stateside that summer and moved out to San Francisco for a 10-week internship in investment banking. I got a room in a three-bedroom apartment about a mile away from the office and on the same street called Sutter, just a block above Post and below that Geary where it really starts to feel like you are on set for an episode of The Walking Dead. Still, Sutter was pleasant enough and I enjoyed walking down it each morning, rain or shine, on my way to the office.\n\nThe habit stuck when I joined full-time the following summer and even after I moved to an apartment that was more like two and a half miles away. On Fridays, when I got out at a reasonable hour, I would enjoy the walk home as well, a rarer treat and welcomed way to start the weekend.\n\nI brought the habit back to New York too and the weather was worse but the vibe was better and there's no place on earth where the hard heel of a brown leather shoe clicks when it hits the ground like it does in New York, surrounded by suits and hunter boots on a rainy day.\n\nIn the last year, I started running more and walking less, but in the last couple of months, I have started walking more again. While running at a slow enough pace (which I prefer) may come to feel like a natural state of movement which one could continue for any distance and any time, walking naturally is that activity and it always feels that way. In my experience, it takes many more miles of walking than running to feel truly tired -- you can just go and go and go, so long as you don't get bored of it. For my commutes, I often listened to music or nothing at all. Now, I usually listen to podcasts, if anything. I find the podcast keeps me away from boredom but also away from my surroundings and my thoughts or undistracted being, all of which there is something to be said for. An hour-long walk without audio may sound intimidatingly boring and ancient but if we are to learn anything from some of the great creatives of the last few centuries, there is something to be said for the simple walk in and of itself.\n\nI believe walking is good for the mind, body, and what some people call soul. I've been thinking a lot this year about some of the best ways to spend my time for the purposes of health, wealth, and happiness. While I may not get wealthy directly by walking, I'll probably be healthier and happier, and any activity that covers two out of the three main things reliably is probably something worth doing for me. I appreciate that just because many of the greats walked a lot does not mean that it was causal to their success or that it is necessarily a great thing to do. I certainly would not suggest trying to keep up with many of them in the number of cigarettes smoked throughout a lifetime. Nonetheless, I think walking is a worthwhile habit to experiment with incorporating into one's daily routine, so long as one is able, and if it proves to be something that one enjoys and feels is good for them, well, it seems good to do the things we enjoy which feel good for us. Time for a walk for me."}]}

I hope she will not mind my sharing that she is turning 25. I think it is a great age. I myself have been 25 for several months now and I certainly dig it so far.\n\nNaturally, we were talking about birthdays yesterday and she made me aware of something somewhat odd about them that I had never considered before. When someone on your 25th birthday, for example, wishes you a happy birthday and says something like \"I hope your 25th year is the best one yet!\", this is not exactly an accurate thing to say. Just as you begin your 2nd year of life on the day you turn 1, you begin your 26th year on the day you turn 25.\n\nI got to wondering who decided that we would identify our age in years based on the latest whole number that we had completed as opposed to the current year that we are in. I figured it had something to do with the language used for the common phrase of saying one's age as it would not be right to say \"I am 26 years old\" when one is only a month or two into his or her 26th year. Something like \"I am in my 26th year\" or \"I am on 26\" would work better for that. Sure enough, I looked it up and in South Korea you are 1 on the day you are born.\n\nI suppose it should not come as much of a surprise that most of the world counts age by the lesser year rather than the greater one. Everyone wants to seem younger than they are.\n\nAnyway, by the time Lauren sees this she will have landed in London with her friends for what I trust will be an amazing few days in one of her favorite cities in the world. I hope her 26th year is the best one yet!"}]}

He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn't, pays it.\"\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term, here is an easy way to think about the power of compound interest: if you improve something by 1% every day for a year, by the end of that year, it will be more than 37 times what it started.\n\nHere is an example of how that works: if a person starts with $100 and increases it by a total of 1% everyday for a year, the first day, a 1% increase would add $1. The second day, a 1% increase would add $1.01 ($100 + $1 = $101 and $101 x 1% = $1.01). The third day, a 1% increase would add $1.0201, and so on. Continue this for a year and by the end of it that $100 will have turned into $3,778. Don't believe it? See below. Compound interest works for more than just money -- things like knowledge, relationships, specific skills, and more. Remember Einstein's quote. Learn it and earn it."}]}

That is like saving 6 trees or over 200 square feet of Arctic ice every year.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with the terminology, that is okay. I was like you not too long ago. A person’s carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide produced directly or indirectly in support of the life that person leads. When a person has a carbon footprint of zero, that means they are carbon neutral. In other words, it means that their impact on Earth’s atmosphere is zero. It is neutral.\n\nIt took me a few years to get my carbon footprint down to 7 tons per year in the first place. It used to be closer to the American average of 19.5. We are lucky that what is good for Earth is often good for us too. I started doing things that were good for Earth and good for me, mostly because they were good for me. I did not know much about the climate crisis back then.\n\nI walked to work. I kept my electric bill down. I tried to buy things less often and more locally. I lived in minimalist apartments in San Francisco and New York. I even started eating vegan during the week. These choices made me healthier and happier while lowering my carbon footprint. Still, they did not make me carbon neutral. I did not think that was possible.\n\nThen I found Wren.\n\nWren made it look easy to go carbon neutral. It quickly turned out to be even easier than it looked.\n\nWren helped me calculate my carbon footprint with some simple questions. Then it showed me how much I could contribute on a monthly basis to any of a few trustworthy projects that would offset my carbon footprint to zero. I chose to support a community tree planting project in East Africa. Like all the other things that are good for Earth and good for us, the tree planting project is good for Earth and good for the people involved. I committed less than $6 per month. That was the moment I became carbon neutral.\n\nSome people say the climate crisis is too large a problem for any individual to make a difference. Those people must not have read about The Civil Rights Movement. They must have missed the #MeToo Movement too. They must not know Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old environmental activist from Sweden who stood up to the leaders of the world and last year became the youngest ever Time Person of the Year.\n\nWe cannot all be the next Greta Thunberg, but we can all join the global movement to end the climate crisis. We can all do things that are better for Earth and better for us. We can all become climate neutral as individuals, and then as humanity. We can all help save Earth.\n\nI recommend going to projectwren.com to get started."}]}

One does not need to look any further than the latest polls to find an argument in favor of those two substitutions. The issue is with the criteria for qualification which includes both polling and fundraising thresholds.\n\n\"He said, she said\" \\-- For those who do not know, in the days leading up to this debate, Warren said that Bernie told her in a 2018 meeting that he did not think a woman could win the election. Bernie has unequivocally denied this. Frankly, I cannot imagine that he would have said anything of the sort and find his reasoning on why he did not and would never have to be pretty clearly convincing. Regardless, someone is lying, and that is the only real takeaway from my perspective. Everyone knows a woman can win. As Bernie pointed out in his own defense, Hillary won the popular vote in 2016. How anyone could think a woman could not win, I do not know, but whether Warren or Klobuchar can win is another story. At the end of the debate, it looked like Warren snubbed Bernie when he reached out for handshake. Steyer got caught in the middle. I don't think any of this looks good for Warren and I think Bernie will have the vast majority of her supporters on his side before it is all said and done.\n\nBernie-Tulsi 2020 \\-- I have been saying it for months and will write it now here on the blog. I believe Bernie should and very well may announce Tulsi Gabbard as his running mate if he wins the democratic nod. I actually think he would be wise to do this while the democratic primary remains ongoing (though I doubt he will), specifically if and when he edges out Warren and has only one or two of the more conservative Democrats left to beat. Many people do not know that Tulsi resigned as DNC chair in 2016 in order to endorse Bernie for President. She was also his VP on the California write-in ballots in 2016, though it is important to note that this was chosen by electors, not by Bernie.\n\nBloomberg \\-- While he was visibly absent from the debates, Mike Bloomberg made his presence felt in other ways which kept him in the news. His social media team sent out dozens of silly tweets including a poll that asked \"which wild animal would be most fun to release onto the debate stage without warning?\" An Ostrich won with 45%. More importantly, Bloomberg wrote an op-ed urging the democratic party to focus less on the first two voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire and more on the battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, and North Carolina, all of which Trump won by slim margins in the 2016 election. I think this is a great point by Bloomberg.\n\nIn closing, I thought the answers to the opening question on foreign policy were generally weak, as was the quality of debate between everyone's differing proposals for healthcare reform. I should mention that I thought Buttigieg did better than Biden, and there is no reason in particular why I did not mention either of them above. Lastly, I thought the program should have started an hour earlier because if I am not keeping the TV on late enough to watch all of it, I doubt a lot of people are. There are already too few people paying far too little attention. Let us not make it more difficult for everyone."}]}

So that’s the purpose of this post — to explain NFTs.\n\n## NFTs are collectibles.\n\nYou know what collectibles are. Here are 10 familiar examples:\n\n   pokémon cards\n\n   baseball cards\n\n   beanie babies\n\n   vinyl records\n\n   comic books\n\n   watches\n\n   stamps\n\n   coins\n\n   cars\n\n   art\n\n\n\n\nNFTs are a new kind of collectible. More specifically, they are digital collectibles. They may eventually be more than that, but they are at least that, so let’s start there.\n\n## Digital collectibles can be valuable.\n\n(just like physical collectibles, even though you can’t touch them)\n\nThe examples listed above are all physical collectibles. Digital collectibles are a bit different. Namely, you can touch physical collectibles, but you can’t touch digital collectibles. This confuses people, but it shouldn’t. Just because you can’t touch something doesn’t mean it can’t have value. \n\nConsider domain names (websites) for example. Domain names are sort of like digital collectibles. Google owns a highly valuable collection of domain names including google.com, gmail.com, youtube.com, and others alike. You can’t touch google.com, but it is obviously valuable. You could offer Google $1 million. Google would never sell it to you.\n\n## NFTs are digital collectibles.\n\nToday, the most popular term for describing digital collectibles is “NFTs”. One example of an NFT collection is ENS names. ENS names are like domain names, but instead of ending with “.com”, they end with “.eth”, and instead of representing a website, they represent a crypto address. That means you can send digital assets to them. So if Google owned google.eth, you could send cryptocurrency to Google by sending it to google.eth. \n\nENS names can be valuable, just like domain names. Vitalik Buterin is the creator of Ethereum and one of the most well-known individuals in crypto. Vitalik owns vitalik.eth. You could offer him $1 million for vitalik.eth, and it’s probably not as valuable to him as google.com is to Google, but I don’t think he would sell it to you for $1 million.\n\nAnother example of an NFT collection is CryptoPunks. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 NFTs that look like these:\n\n## Some collectibles can be really valuable.\n\nIndividual NFTs from the CryptoPunks collection have sold for millions of dollars. That might seem silly, but some people really value certain collectibles. This has been true for centuries in the world of physical collectibles, and so far it has held true in the world of digital collectibles as well. \n\nHere are a few examples of physical collectibles that have sold for a lot of money:\n\nAnd here are a few examples of NFTs that have sold for a lot of money as well:\n\nI could show you countless other examples of each, but you get the point. It is fair to wonder why these collectibles are so valuable. I don’t really understand multi-million dollar stamps myself. But the thing is, it doesn’t matter if I understand it. It is what it is. People have valued baseball cards and stamps for decades and it seems likely that they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Collectibles are status symbols.\n\nWe don’t need to understand why all of these different kinds of collectibles are considered valuable in order to understand that they are considered valuable, but we can try. One simple way to think about collectibles is as status symbols. After all, you can’t really do anything with baseball cards or beanie babies besides buy them, hold them, enjoy them, show them off, and sell them. But watches are a bit different. You can do something with a watch. You can wear it and you can tell the time. Watches serve a function, and a useful one at that, but that is not why they are valuable. Rolex watches routinely sell for tens of thousands of dollars, but they don’t tell the time any better than a $50 Timex. They are status symbols. You don’t buy a Rolex to tell the time. You buy a Rolex to show your status.\n\n## Digital collectibles are no different.\n\nCryptoPunks are status symbols, just like Rolex watches. If you wear a Rolex watch, people will assume you are wealthy and successful. Similarly, if you have a CryptoPunk as your profile picture on Twitter, people will assume you are wealthy and that you were early to appreciate digital art, which might even mean you are smart. CryptoPunks are cool, just like Rolex watches, so some people value them both very highly. It might not make sense to you, just like paying millions of dollars for stamps doesn’t make sense to me, but it makes sense to some people. And you don’t need everyone to value CryptoPunks for CryptoPunks to be extremely valuable. You really only need a few people. The internet connects everyone in the world. If you can find one person who is willing to pay $1 million for your CryptoPunk, then that’s how much you can sell it for. And if you sell it for $1 million, then that’s what it’s worth. It doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks.\n\n## The collectibles market is big.\n\nNow, it is worth considering the value of NFTs (digital collectibles) relative to the value of all collectibles (the vast majority of which are physical collectibles) because it makes it seem obvious that the digital collectibles market is going to grow, potentially a lot. Currently, the global collectibles market is estimated to be worth around half a trillion dollars, or $473.81 billion to be precise. The NFT market, on the other hand, is currently estimated to be worth $4.7 billion. That means digital collectibles currently represent just 1% of the total collectibles market.\n\n## Digital collectibles are still small.\n\nNFTs are still just a few years old, so while they’re relatively small today, it’s reasonable to say it’s still early. A good analogy could be to compare NFTs today to e-commerce in 2000. Just as NFTs represent 1% of the total collectibles market today, e-commerce represented 1% of the US retail market in 2000. Look at how it has grown since:\n\nToday, e-commerce represents more than 15% of the US retail market. Could NFTs represent 15% of the total collectibles market in 25 years? Neither the US retail market nor the total collectibles market is staying stagnant either, so the digital piece is not just a growing slice of the pie, but a growing slice of a growing pie. In fact, while e-commerce has increased from 1% to 15% of the US retail market, the actual value of e-commerce sales has increased from $5.7 billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $289 billion in the first quarter of 2024. That’s a 50x increase in about 25 years.\n\n## Digital collectibles are coming.\n\nI don’t know if digital collectibles are going to represent 15% of the total collectibles market in 25 years, or if the total value of all digital collectibles is going to increase 50x in the next 25 years. I don’t even know if they’ll still be called “NFTs”. All I know is that I will be extremely surprised if the digital collectibles market does not increase significantly both as a percentage of the total collectibles market, and in terms of its total value in the years to come. If you have a good argument for why the digital collectibles market should not represent at least 5% of the total collectibles market or increase at least 10x in value, I would love to hear it. As with most things, I’m open to changing my mind.\n\n## Base Colors are next.\n\nI hope this was helpful, and that you now feel you have a decent understanding of NFTs. Now that I have written this, I plan to write about my project specifically in a follow-up post. I believe it is something fundamentally new and interesting, but it is easiest to describe it simply as an NFT project for now. If you are curious to check it out, go to basecolors.com, where you can buy and name colors as digital collectibles. There is only one NFT for every digital color in the world. So there are 16,777,216 colors, but no two people can own the same color, and no two colors can have the same name. We made it easy enough so that anyone should be able to get a color. And if you have any questions, you can email me at jake@basecolors.com and I’ll be more than happy to help. As always, thank you for reading. I appreciate your support."}]}

I had just finished a 3 mile run and it was the first thing I read on my phone. At first, I did not believe it. I googled it. It was true. I sat down on the pavement, shocked. I did not know what else to do.\n\nPeople talk about always remembering where they were when xyz happened. I never really understood that before, but I think this might have been one of those moments. Disbelief, shock, and sadness were felt all over the world yesterday by tens if not hundreds of millions of people I imagine. I cannot imagine the pain and devastation of those who actually knew Kobe, his daughter Gigi, or any of the other seven people who tragically died in yesterday's horrible and sickening accident. My sincere condolences to all of them, and to anyone else who is grieving today.\n\nAfter the news, I spent several hours watching ESPN and thumbing through Twitter to see the outpouring of emotions from people all over the world -- athletes, fans, presidents, friends, anyone, and, seemingly, everyone. More than ever, I appreciated Twitter as a medium on which the world could grieve together, where people who knew him best could share stories of what made him best.\n\nI tried to figure out why it was hitting me so hard and how I could react to the death of someone I never met with such shock and sadness. For the most part, I think it was a combination of two things.\n\nFirst, he was THE basketball player of my childhood. People argue frequently about who is the goat (greatest of all time). The debate usually is focused on Michael Jordan and LeBron, but forgetting all-time for a moment, from 2000 to 2010, from when I was 6 to 16 years old, it was all Kobe. For that decade, Kobe was the goat. His individual accolades only began with the fact that he was an All-Star all of those years, won an MVP, and two Finals MVPs. His teams won 5 championships in those 11 years. Kobe was a champion, a winner, an icon, and an idol.\n\nSecond, it was not what Kobe did but how he did it that was most inspiring. There were countless examples because it was the way he lived every day. Not flinching at Matt Barnes' pump fake at his head. Shooting the free throws after rupturing his achilles. Scoring 60 points in his final game. The stories of his work ethic. The things he would say to younger players. Kobe had a swagger about him that came naturally from his supreme confidence that was earned through relentless drive, discipline and hard work, the \"Mamba Mentality\" to get better every day at the game that he loved and the thing that he was most obsessed with for most of his life. His attitude was not just what made him great as a player. It was what made him so successful as a person, and such a compelling inspiration to the world. We saw what he did on the court throughout his nearly unparalleled career, but what saddens me most is what yesterday's tragedy robbed us of in terms of how much more he had left to offer the world, as demonstrated by the things he continued to do day in and day out.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Kobe was on a mission to share wisdom with people in a way that would make the world a better place. He wanted to continue to inspire people. After he retired, he wrote books and produced a podcast series for kids. He mentored young players (both male and female) in a self-described effort to help move the game forward. That is part of why his final tweet congratulating LeBron on passing his third place spot on the all time scoring list is so difficult to read today.\n\nThinking about how I want to remember Kobe, and how I want to make my small individual contribution to carrying on his legacy, two things came to mind. First, I will strive to be a little more like Kobe. Second, I will help spread his wise words which serve as guides for how to do that, both through his own words and through my interpretations of them.\n\nOn that first point, this morning I ran 8 miles out of respect for Kobe because, as many of you know, that was one of his jersey numbers (his other number was 24 and I have not run more than 3 miles in one go in a couple of months so 8 was plenty challenging for me). I realized on my run that Kobe's numbers 24/8 seemed to describe his work ethic. It was as if he could somehow work a day more every week than everyone else could have done working 24/7. I also learned today that he chose the number 24 in large part as a reminder to take things one day at a time, and somewhat eerily, \"to live every day as if it was my last\". I listened to an awesome podcast with Kobe for the first half of my run and part of a second one (where the above quote about his number came from) until the last mile of my run when I took my headphones out just to focus on the running. I pushed myself hard on pace for short stretches of that last mile and when I was about a quarter mile from the finish a woman slowed her car and rolled her window down to ask me if I was okay. She said she had seen me earlier and that I did not look okay. At this point I was not pushing so hard and I was able to laugh and tell her I was good and thank her for checking on me. I was happy to know that I was pushing hard enough to look not okay enough for someone to stop and check on me. That had never happened to me before. I smiled for the rest of the run. Kobe probably got that all the time.\n\nIn terms of the second part about spreading Kobe's message, as with anything, the best time to begin is now. Below are some bits of wisdom I have gained just in the last 24 hours from clips that people have shared of him and the podcasts I listened to this morning.\n\n\"I have no fear whatsoever. If I take the last second shot and miss, so what.\" (ESPN) Kobe did not fear failure. He embraced opportunity. He shot his shots, including the biggest shots in the biggest games. One of his earliest failures was in Game 5 versus the Jazz in the 1997 Western Conference Semifinals when Kobe shot 4 air-balls in 5 minutes. Those were the biggest shots in the final minutes of his team's biggest game of the year, and the biggest of his career to that point. He later said that he knew it was not the pressure that got to him but the lack of strength moving from 30 game high school seasons to 80+ game NBA schedules. He took the lesson from that failure that he needed to get stronger and 3 years later his team was winning championships. I believe that failure is a prerequisite for success. If you are not failing, you are not shooting the big shots. I want to shoot like Kobe.\n\n\"Do not negotiate with yourself.\" (1st podcast) Kobe said that when you tell yourself you are going to do something, you are signing a contract with yourself. You cannot negotiate after that. The contract is signed. You have to go do it. I too believe in doing what you say you are going to do, what you set out to do. I find myself negotiating with myself all the time but I will remember more often now not to.\n\n\"I expected to win 8.\" (1st podcast) Kobe was talking about his expectations for the number of championships he would win. He expected to win 8 but instead he won 5. He failed to meet his own expectations but he exceeded everyone else's with the 5 championships that helped make him an unequivocal success and one of the greatest basketball players of all time. I think eventually he probably came to view it all as a success as well, but the point is that sometimes success comes in the form of failing to meet one's high expectations for oneself while still coming close. The expectations need to be incredibly high if one wants to be great. Kobe came into the league as a 17-year-old kid telling people he was going to be the next Michael Jordan. Most people would say that he fell slightly short of that expectation for himself too, but no one would ever dare to call Kobe a failure. Kobe was one of the greatest of all time, I believe, because his expectations were to become the greatest of all time and because he knew the amount of work and dedication that he would have to put in to accomplish that expectation. He wanted to take the biggest shots there were to take. He did not negotiate with himself. He just did what he knew he needed to do every single day. He may have failed, but his coming close won him 5 NBA Championships and global recognition as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.\n\nFinally, for anyone facing the the question of how to move forward from this and/or future tragedies, we may find the way forward through the wise words of none other than Kobe himself, as copied below:\n\n\"Have a good time. Enjoy life. Life is too short to get bogged down and be discouraged. You have to keep moving. You have to keep going. Put one foot in front of the other, smile, and just keep on rolling.\"\n\nRest in peace to Gigi and the rest of those passengers who are gone now far too soon.\n\nRest in peace, Kobe. Thank you, and much respect."}]}

Yesterday, I listened to this conversation between two particularly smart, particularly stoic Austin-dwellers, Tim Ferriss and Ryan Holiday. I have read one book from each of them, The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim, and The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan, and I recommend them both with the former having had a greater impact on me personally. In their recent conversation, Tim and Ryan broach the subject of investing as much more than a framework through which one can make money, but also as one through which people can make better decisions in life. This is what prompted my writing for today.\n\nThe title multivariable investing is intended to define a world of investment decisions in which the input is of a different nature than the output. In other words, there are both apples and oranges involved, as the idiom goes, and a bunch of different berries as well. A simple example is an investment of time (the input) for money (the output). Most people make this investment everyday, or at least 5 days a week. They put in their time to a job that will pay out their money. Oversimplifying the situation, their time is their initial capital, the job is the investment, and their money is the returned capital, or the total capital that is generated by the investment of the initial capital in the given investment opportunity (their job). Of course, their are skills that are grown and relationships that are developed and otherwise, but like I said, this is an oversimplification on purpose.\n\nNow, if one is to also assume that the universe of investment opportunities for one's time is comprised solely and in its entirety of the universe of traditional job opportunities, then the best investment of time would be the traditional job opportunity with the highest expected rate of return. Using the prior example, let us assume that the variables in the investment are still restricted to time in for money out. In that case, the job opportunity (the investment opportunity) that pays the most money (the output) per unit of time (the input), represents the best investment. In reality, it is not quite so simple because, as I mentioned in this previous post, time, like most things, becomes more valuable as it becomes more scarce (i.e. the more hours you work, the more valuable time becomes). Still, for the sake of getting where I am going, let us continue to assume the situation is as simple as described.\n\nThe question that I really want to get at is how in life to think about multivariable investing when the universe of traditional job opportunities makes up only a very small fraction of the universe of total investment opportunities, and the multiple number of variables is not just two (time & money), but far greater. This is much closer to reality. Professional investors frequently talk about the term AUM or Assets Under Management. Their assets are dollars and it is fairly simple for them to calculate the returns on their investments and to track their performance by their rate of return over time. As humans investing assets of our own, this is a much more complex and difficult task. We have many more kinds of assets under management than only dollars. We have time, money, health, effort, energy, and emotions, to name a few.\n\nThe question then is how can we think about investing the number of different assets that we have under our own personal management when the number of different assets that can be returned by our investments are equally numerous and often (if not always) coexisting on both sides of an arguably infinite number of equations that are available for our consideration in the form of investment opportunities, otherwise known as decisions. We make countless decisions everyday, investing time and money and otherwise while hardly thinking (and more often not thinking at all) about what we are putting in and what we expect to get out of a given investment. I do not mean to suggest that this is a problem, for a life spent wholly thinking about how to spend it does not sound like a life well spent at all.\n\nStill, I do believe it is worth spending some time thinking about how we are investing our many assets, and most notably, our time itself. In case it is not abundantly clear, I have invested a good amount of time over the last few months considering how I want to spend and invest my time now and in the future, because I believe thinking about it and experimenting with it will be well worthwhile. I wrote about why I quit my job as an investment banker a few months ago, and it had to do a lot with my conviction and faith in my prediction that following my interests for up to a year would yield greater overall returns in the long run than would a third year in my old job, the returns of which were disproportionately made up of the money category and the total merits of which I figured I could probably regain after a year if I wanted to (by getting my old job back). I have since invested more time in my relationships and my health, in learning, writing, and traveling, among other things, and as I am now getting used to having less scarcity in terms of my time, I find that I am more excited by opportunities to invest a larger amount of it in one or more pursuits that I am increasingly confident will be time and effort well spent.\n\nI have not hardly cracked the surface on how many considerations there are to be had in this subject. The question that I have raised is really no smaller than that of how one should spend a life. Ultimately, barring any exponential developments in the captivating science of human longevity, and assuming there is no Superman living among us, everyone who lives one day dies. So, in terms of investing time, money, or otherwise, the personal and individual return in the end will be zero. There may be no assets under management in the end, but I do not believe that it is a zero sum game. The investment of one's life in pursuits that return more broadly than only back to one's self may be a good place to pick up at another time. The concepts of saving and spending in addition to investing are also things that I am thinking about which may be worth further consideration as well, but I feel that I have invested enough time writing for today. If you have read this far, I hope that you feel that your time invested was worthwhile. The more of you who do, the more that mine was."}]}

The company is building a privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol (\"PPPOPP\") with the ambitious objective of onboarding billions of people into the world of crypto and web3 via the worldcoin app and wallet. As per the mission, it will give these people free money in the form of worldcoin tokens (\"WLD\") to get on board, and that is just the beginning.\n\nSince the company was publicly announced via Twitter on October 21, 2021, it has been bombarded by skeptics. Some of these skeptics may be genuinely concerned. Others seem superficially motivated by the status-upping satisfaction of scoring a \"kill\". Regardless, my objective in writing this particular piece is not to explore what could go wrong. Plenty of others have done that already. Rather, I will operate under the assumption that the team behind Worldcoin is sincerely seeking to build something useful and good for the world, that their reasoning is reasonable, that their technologies are (or will be) about as functional as they've been described, and that this big bet that they can get a billion users could actually work. In layman's terms, I will give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nSo, how does Worldcoin actually work? Here is how it works from a prospective user’s point of view. First, you have to go out in the physical world and find a representative of Worldcoin who has the ability to onboard you to the protocol. In reality, right now there are only a few dozen of these representatives around the world, so it will probably be futile to go looking for one. Most likely, one of them will come to a place near you eventually, you will hear about it because it is their job to make sure you do, and then you can go to wherever they are, or maybe they will come to you. These representatives are called Orb Operators. An Orb Operator operates an orb. An orb is a cutting edge technological device designed and manufactured by Worldcoin to do a few specific things which in sum suffice to onboard new users and give them their Worldcoin wallets with some free tokens (WLD). \n\nThis is what an orb looks like.\n\nHere is my high-level understanding of what exactly the orb does, in practical, non-technical terms. First, it scans a person's eyes, specifically their iris, and uses that naturally unique human biometric to generate a different and separate unique identifier, a simple string of letters and numbers. Assuming that unique identifier is not already in the system (if it was, that would mean this person has already been onboarded), it is converted to what can be thought of as a fungible digital ticket. This ticket is used to claim a new wallet. The multi-step process is in place to ensure two layers of privacy protection. The wallet cannot be reverse matched to the unique identifier nor can the unique identifier be reverse matched to the iris scan, which is deleted after it is used. This is what makes it a privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol. The fact that only a living human's iris may be used to generate a new wallet ensures that each wallet represents an individual person and that no one person may create more than one wallet. The multi-step process uses zero-knowledge proofs to preserve privacy as this is done.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nSo, what is the point of a privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol, what is the problem it aims to solve, and why is that an important problem to solve? The point is to prove that a particular wallet address is the only wallet address on that protocol representing a certain individual person. The problems that this solves are of the sort we see caused by spam bots and Sybil attacks. A Sybil attack is essentially when a bad actor creates a bunch of bots in order to gain outsized influence within a network. There are a number of useful things that are hard or impossible to do because the problem of preventing Sybil attacks has not been solved.\n\nHere is one example. Imagine a decentralized autonomous organization (\"DAO\") wants to make decisions in a decentralized and maximally democratic manner. The DAO would like to give every person in its community one vote on every issue. In an attempt to achieve this, they could give a vote to every Ethereum wallet that connects with their website, but this would be imperfect at best and entirely ineffective at worst, depending on how successful some people may be in seeking to gain an unfair advantage by obtaining the ability to vote multiple times. For instance, If there were 100 people in the community and 1 of them really wanted a particular decision to be made, he could create 99 wallets in addition to his first, connect them all with the website, vote 100 times, and ensure that his decision wins assuming the other 99 people in the community do not try something similar themselves. Voting is just one example of something that is hard to do without Sybil resistance but becomes more practically possible with a working proof-of-personhood protocol like Worldcoin purports it can be, and not just one person one vote voting, but innovative alternatives like quadratic voting as well.\n\nAnother example of something made feasible by a working proof-of-personhood protocol is Universal Basic Income (\"UBI\"). Imagine some government, organization, individual, or group wanted to provide a UBI for everyone in the world in a future where artificial general intelligence (\"AGI\") has rendered many humans jobless. Surely we would not want to give bad actors multiples more money than others simply because they are able to appear as if they are many individual people. Again, the ability to prove that a unique address represents a unique and individual person becomes useful. As a third example, if a new product wants to incentivize users to sign up by giving them $10, they could do that with a proof-of-personhood protocol. Without this or something like this, they might risk giving many bonuses to bots created by an individual with no intention of actually trying the product. The list of unlocked opportunities goes on. \n\nCurrently, there are of course some attempted solutions to this general category of problems. There are Know Your Customer (\"KYC\") services which leverage government-issued passports, IDs, facial scans, and the like to prove a person is who they say they are, and there are CAPTCHAs (those 4 by 4 panel pictures that ask you to \"select all the squares with traffic lights\") to separate people from bots, but these and other solutions are insufficient to unlock the full range of possibilities on a global scale, nor to do it in a decentralized manner. It is estimated that 1 billion people globally do not have any proof of identity, and while a CAPTCHA shows that you are not a robot, it does not show that you haven't been through that CAPTCHA before.\n\nHow is it going?\n\nNow that we have some understanding of what Worldcoin is and why it matters, let us consider its current adoption. Here are some approximate numbers as of early summer 2022 according to a number of public sources including articles and podcasts. There are around 30 Orb Operators, each with an orb, operating in about 24 different countries. They have onboarded about 700,000 users, who can be thought of as beta testers, as we understand things are not yet working entirely as they eventually are expected to, and these beta testers will have the opportunity to onboard again once everything goes live. It looks like it took roughly 6 months to get the first 100,000 onboarded (as per the chart below) and another 6 months to get the next 600,000 -- not a bad little growth curve.\n\n[URL]\n\nWhere is it going?\n\nThe company is estimating it will have onboarded several million users by the end of 2022, which would require the continued acceleration of a growth curve that has already been quite impressive to date. For some added perspective, it is estimated that there are between 100 and 300 million crypto users globally, so it could be that nearly 10% of all crypto users worldwide will have Worldcoin wallets by the end of this year if the company hits its ambitious projections. Early Orb Operators have onboarded around 700 or 800 people per week and in some cases more than 2,000. While there are only about 30 orbs out there today, Worldcoin projects to distribute between 1,000 and 2,000 by the end of this year, and expects to scale production to around 50,000 new orbs in 2023, perhaps producing even more orbs on an annual basis thereafter. If all goes well, Worldcoin considers it within reach that they may scale to 1 billion users in just a few years, and while this may seems like an awfully lofty target, even meeting it halfway for 500 million users would represent around double the number of all crypto users globally today.\n\nAn illustrative model of how Worldcoin could grow to several million users by EOY 2022 and nearly a billion by EOY 2025.\n\nHow will it get there?\n\nWhen it comes to Worldcoin's innovations, naturally, most people's attention will be fixed on the science-fiction-looking orb. It sounds as impressive as it looks given that the team evidently had to invent something better than Apple's face scanning technology or anything else in existence. That said, Worldcoin's decentralized salesforce of Orb Operators may end up looking like just as critical an innovation as any if they are as successful with scaling as they hope to be. If the company can continue to contract highly motivated and resourceful entrepreneur-types from around the world to distribute Worldcoin in their local regions as or more effectively as the early Orb Operators have done to date, the protocol might just have a shot at onboarding those tens or hundreds of millions, even billions of users that they plan to. \n\nIt will likely be as challenging as it will be important to align the incentives of these Orb Operators with everyone else involved with the protocol so that they will use acceptable methods to get people signed up. Ideally, newly onboarded users will understand what Worldcoin is about and thus be more likely to engage with what they are signing up for. Could it be that Orb Operators by the end of this decade are almost as prevalent as Uber drivers (3-4 million)? Probably not, but Worldcoin might not need one-tenth that many to reach substantially every human in the world and onboard them to the Worldcoin protocol. Some of the most successful venture capitalists, individual investors, and entrepreneurs in crypto certainly seem to believe Worldcoin has a shot. Firms and individuals including a16z, Khosla Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, and Multicoin Capital, among many others have invested $125 million in Worldcoin over its last two rounds, most recently at a valuation of $3 billion. Suffice to say, capital should not be the thing that constrains them from getting off to a very nice start.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nWorldcoin has begun a process and published a roadmap proclaiming that they will eventually be open sourcing everything. Its leadership has discussed the concept of progressive decentralization and their goals for community governance in the long-run. Once the protocol is live after mainnet launch, the potential for projects to utilize this privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol seems unbound. Could we all start \"earning\" UBI before we die? What might an open global userbase of billions of proven-to-be-unique people enable the next generation of great organizations to offer? What could this mean for democracy? If only there was somewhere we could look to see the future… perhaps in the eye of an orb."}]}

According to weather.gov, the average temperature in Central Park during January has been between 25 and 41 degrees Fahrenheit every year since 2000. This was obviously an extraordinary weekend in New York City.\n\nI cannot say with certainty that the temperature in New York City this weekend was a symptom of the climate crisis. It is going to be back down in the 40's this week and I am hesitant to argue that any couple of days represents a symptom of a trend when it could correctly or incorrectly just be disregarded as an outlier. Nonetheless, a weekend like this does bring people's attention to the issue, and I want to briefly touch upon the nature of that attention that is being brought.\n\nMost people do not want to think about the climate crisis for the same reason that they do not want to think about any crisis -- it is not pleasant to think about. Additionally, most people do not think that they have to think about the climate crisis because their perception is that its impacts are still a long ways away. This false perception is not helped by days like this past weekend in New York City. If the impact of climate change is simply a nice weekend in the winter followed by a prompt return to relatively normal winter weather, it does not feel like anything very bad is happening very quickly. We then have this unfortunate dynamic where the events that are triggering attention to the issue are not really representative of the issue itself and so the severity of the issue is discounted because the thing that is bringing it the attention is not at all comparable in its magnitude.\n\nIn the last 115 years, Arctic temperatures have increased 7 degrees Fahrenheit versus global temperatures which have increased only 2 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 140 years. Even in the Arctic, that change in temperature over the course of a lifetime can hardly be felt as it changes gradually year over year. It is important to recognize that the issue with climate change is not that the living temperature itself will become fatal in the near future. Rather, the issue is that these seemingly small but still accelerating rises in temperature will have catastrophic effects on humanity and overall life on earth. One of the more easily foreseeable examples will be the displacement of massive populations from coastal areas due to rising sea levels from the melting of Arctic ice.\n\nThere are a number of other reasons why the climate crisis is not getting the attention it deserves, including but not limited to the extreme complexity of the issue, its possible impacts (both direct and indirect), and the timeline on which those impacts will occur, as well as the unprecedented level of competition for people's attention that is driving humanity's inability to focus on important things.\n\nI will end for now with something that may help get some people's attention. Below is a quote from a post from Albert Wenger, whose blog finally drew my attention to the climate crisis and whose free book (which I coincidentally recommended in yesterday's post) drew my attention to the issue of the scarcity of attention itself.\n\n\"Imagine the following scene: alien spaceships in orbit around earth, dropping nuclear bombs into our atmosphere at the rate of 1 bomb per second with the goal of overheating earth and destroying all life on it. \"\n\nToday I read this article (and the study which it references) which calculates that the oceans are actually heating up at a rate of 5 Hiroshima bombs per second. The scene that Albert asked us to imagine is dangerously real. As he points out later in his post, if aliens were the cause, we would join together internationally to combat this obvious threat to the earth. Instead, humans are the cause, and only some of the world is very slowly beginning to work together to combat it. I have long said that the best thing for world peace would be for everyone to have a common enemy. This could be it."}]}

The weekend prior, I was accepted to Stanford. Well, not exactly. I was accepted to an experimental online class from Stanford called Code in Place which is based on the school's well-regarded CS106A Programming Methodology course.\n\nAfter being rejected by Stanford twice, once for undergraduate coming out of my gap year in 2013 and a second time for their Deferred Enrollment MBA program in 2017, it was nice to finally get some good news back from the Silicon Valley school where Google was born and Steve Jobs spoke.\n\nFor the record, I consider myself very fortunate to have received both of those rejections because, without them, everything afterwards would have changed. I choose to appreciate everything about my past because I do not see much benefit in wondering how things could have gone differently or wishing for ways in which they could have.\n\nAnyway, a combination of discovering this course from Stanford one day, a class from Yale the next day, and a number of classes from Harvard the day after that made me realize that the coming shift in higher education has already begun.\n\nBefore speculating upon what that shift may look like, it is important to acknowledge that one of two things is likely to happen, and they represent very different scenarios. The first scenario is easier to imagine but harder for me to believe which is that universities will open up again next fall as if it is business, or rather, education as usual. This seems unlikely to me, but with an accelerated path to an effective vaccine or the introduction of some other unforeseen factor, I am hesitant to count it out completely while it still remains within the realm of possibility from my perspective. The second scenario which I believe is much more likely is that we will not go back to education as usual in the fall. Instead, education will continue to be online as it has been for the last few weeks under the guise of a temporary solution to be relied on only during this thought to be relatively short-lived shelter-in-place period. This shift to online education is somewhat obvious and predictable if in fact circumstances remain several months from now so that live in-person classes in the physical world will no longer be feasible, practical, or responsible, and it is important to remember that if any institution is going to risk lives and people's health, liberal arts colleges are probably the least likely of them all to do so. What is not as obvious or easily predictable from my perspective is how the new digital format for classes will change countless other aspects of higher education and society at large.\n\nScott Galloway had an excellent monologue on this subject in the most recent episode of his eponymous podcast, The Prof G Show. (For those who read a previous post in which I tried to use the word eponymous but somewhat forced it, hopefully we can agree this usage was much cleaner and closer to correct.) In his monologue, Scott talks about how elite universities have become the ultimate luxury brands by rejecting over 90% of their prospective customers otherwise known as students unlike even the most luxurious brands in the world like Rolex or Louis Vuitton or Rolls Royce would ever consider doing. He talks about how the value-add of universities lies as much or more in the certification than in the education and how higher education is ripe for disruption based on what he calls a disruptability index which he defines as \"a function of your ability to increase prices faster than inflation without having any underlying increase in productivity of the product.\" I liked that straight forward definition. Lastly, Scott talks about how schools will still want to make money and says that they will need to accept many more students in order to maintain revenues because their excessive prices, which have already garnered plenty of attention but which to date have been unrelenting due to continued demand, will now become much more egregiously apparent to even the wealthiest of parents who will have no choice but to ask why they are paying $50,000 a year for their child to join 3 or 4, 20- or 200- person Zoom classes per day, five or even only four or three days per week, taught by someone who seems less effective at online education than the people who teach the free Khan Academy videos. The college price tag that used to be justified by not only the certification but the overall experience and the access to resources and the dining hall and the dorms and the people to meet and the lifelong relationships to form, in addition to the hopefully premium version of an actual education which I am by no means discounting but simply pales in comparison to the monetary value that the word Wharton on a resume affords an individual to more easily earn over their lifetime compared to another individual with the word of a university that you or I and therefore most employers have never heard of or do not regard as good, let alone great or elite.\n\nSo, how will it happen that schools will begin to accept more students from whom they can generate lower revenues per student to equal the same or similar revenues as they are accustomed to? I believe we are seeing the beginning of it now, and if that is any indication of the speed and magnitude of the change, it looks poised to be large and fast.\n\nI never previously had the opportunity to be a student at an Ivy League school. Already I now have the opportunity to become a student at all of them, for free. I think what we are seeing now is a land grab, or in more literal terms, a student grab. I believe the top schools are foreseeing the coming disruption of themselves and others and have come to the same conclusion that they need to expand their student base. Based on what I have seen thus far, it seems to me that they are beginning to test and implement a tried and true strategy that has been successful for so many tech and media companies before them, and that is, the freemium strategy.\n\nElite universities are now giving away their most basic offerings for free to get as many students on board as they possibly can so that the base is as large as possible for them to upsell once they figure out how exactly they want to do that based on what they believe will be the best way to monetize their student base which will soon be degrees of magnitude larger than ever before for schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and hopefully my alma mater too. I say hopefully because by default the schools that do not grow will shrink, not only in students but in relevance and prominence and therefore in the benefits that graduates will experience by having their schools' names on their resumes.\n\nPremium products will be varying and virtually limitless and the prices for the very best of them I imagine will be very steep. For example, one may be able to take an intro to macroeconomics class from Harvard for free but the advanced classes as one works his or her way up the chain of prerequisites to the land of advanced electives will cost money, likely more and more of it as the student advances further. Alternatively, I suppose all of those classes could remain free and the approach to charging for premium offerings could be focused more on gaining access to smaller classes or ones with more small group Zoom meetings or ones with better professors with better reviews. Perhaps professors will be paid more like restaurant workers in that they are given a nominal wage in exchange for their work and the opportunity to earn large tips from generous diners for their excellent service, or in this case, ad-hoc income from wealthier students for their one-on-one tutoring sessions or access to office hours. Unlike most restaurant workers, some professors could make an absolute killing this way.\n\nI am not sure exactly how all of this will take shape but I am reasonably confident that if higher education is heading in a digital direction, as it appears to be, then the freemium model will be widely employed. As a result, many more people worldwide will have access to the best schools in the world, which is a good thing, but people will still have to pay potentially steep prices for things like certification which unfortunately are unreasonably valued by top employers making their seemingly unreasonable prices unfortunately reasonable. I'm taking the Code in Place class from Stanford for the next five weeks and I expect to gain the valuable new skill of basic programming for free which is awesome and amazing, but was not surprised when I read in no uncertain terms before applying that I would not be getting any sort of university credit or certification for completing the class. Of course, that would be far too valuable to give away for free. Schools will give away the product but not the certification, because that is the biggest part of what people have been paying for all long. One question I am curious to see answered is what happens when I and the 10,000 other students taking this Code in Place Stanford class with me put it on their resumes anyway? What happens if employers start caring less about where you learned and more about what you know? I suppose as with most things these days, we will just have to do our best to guess, or otherwise wait to find out."}]}

They and others believe that UBI can be one of the most effective ways for us to relieve some of the economic challenges which are presenting themselves to millions of people all across America in the face of the coronavirus pandemic and all of the associated impacts created by necessary social distancing.\n\nAndrew Yang should be given a ton of credit for effectively legitimizing this concept as a result of his presidential campaign which ended just a little over a month ago. His signature policy which he called The Freedom Dividend proposed a universal basic income of $1,000 per month for every American adult. I remember the first time I heard Andrew talk about it at length with Joe Rogan on Joe's podcast about a year ago. I had heard of the concept before that but was convinced of its merit for the first time that day.\n\nThe concept of UBI is not new. The idea was raised in some form or another by the founding fathers, Thomas Paine, and even Martin Luther King, Jr. who said, \"I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.\"\n\nMore recently, in 2017 the concept gained support from Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg while the year before that Obama said, \"we’ll be debating unconditional free money over the next 10 or 20 years.\" My speculative prediction if you had asked me a few months ago would have been generally in line with Obama's, that we might see some form of UBI come to fruition in the USA in the next two or three presidents. Today, I think chances are we very well may see it in the next two or three weeks. This is one of the positives that I believe will come from the tragic pandemic that the world is battling right now.\n\nWhile universal basic income will help a lot of people now in the midst of this crisis, the more common argument prior to these unforeseen events was that it would be needed to counter joblessness as a result of accelerating automation. Andrew's example using truck drivers was what first caught my attention because I recognize that most of these jobs will be replaced by autonomous vehicles in the next few years and, as Andrew points out, there are over 3 million truck drivers in The United States today. That represents about 2% of all US workers. More generally speaking, Andrew's website cites McKinsey in suggesting that up to 1/3 American workers will lose their jobs to automation by 2030. His answer is universal basic income. The argument is not that $1,000 per month is enough to live your normal life, but that it is enough for humans to satisfy their basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. Maybe it is not even enough for that just yet, but it is hard to argue that it would not meaningfully help those who need it most today, and those who will need it most when, not if, they lose their jobs to automation.\n\nThe best argument for and explanation of universal basic income that I have found is in Albert Wenger's book, World After Capital. He calculates that a UBI which pays $1,000/month to adults (18 years and older), $400/month for teens (12 years and older), and $200/month for children (younger than 12) would cost about $3 trillion per year. This, of course, is not a trivial amount of money by any means, but if you consider that The Federal Reserve injected $1.5 trillion into the economy last week, and that by Albert's calculations his proposed form of UBI would increase tax revenues by another $0.7 trillion, you realize that those two sources alone (summing to $2.2 trillion) would just about cover the cost of instituting UBI as per Albert's proposal for the rest of the year ($2.25 trillion to cover 9 months from April through December 2020). That is all without touching the government's existing annual budgets under normal circumstances, which of course would need to be a part of the equation to sustain any sort of UBI model in the long-term.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about universal basic income, I highly recommend you listen to the Joe Rogan Podcast with Andrew Yang and read the \"Economic Freedom\" section in Part 3 of Albert Wenger's book, both of which are linked above.\n\nIt seems silly for me most days to be writing about things that are not somewhat related to all that is going on in the world today. After all, I spend a lot of my time trying to understand how the world works and what the future holds, and those are the kinds of things I most enjoy writing about. That said, I am decidedly going to try to write about some positives that I see coming from all of this, precisely because they are so much harder for me to see than the negatives. I believe in the utility of positivity, so long as it does not serve to excuse irresponsibility (i.e. \"everything will be OK sooo I am going to throw a party and invite everyone I know\"). One of those positives I believe will be a temporary institution of UBI in the US, leading to a more general acceptance of the concept, significantly increased favorability ratings for it, and accelerated progress towards its implementation in perpetuity.\n\nIn a world with so much excess, everyone should have enough money to cover basic human needs."}]}

I tend to have a concave temperament, as Vitalik defines it, or an appreciation for the “Middle Way” or the “Middle Path” as it was described by the Buddha. This is why I think a lot is often lost in tweets where character count limits context and it can be difficult if not impossible to explain the nuances necessary to better convey complex balances between extremes.\n\nOne trap of concave thinking worth keeping in mind is that for many questions for which one may seek to find a balance between, there may be no determinable answer. Vitalik makes an interesting argument for “being concave about concavity” since in some cases convex approaches are better. I would encourage being concave about concavity for another reason too. One must realize that, in trying to find an indeterminable answer between extremes, neither not trying at all nor searching indefinitely for the answer is the right approach. Discovering some guiding principles may be valuable but if there is no ultimate answer to be found then it is likely that additional time spent trying to find the balance beyond some point has diminishing returns. I myself probably lean on the side of searching too much for answers to unsolvable questions, but I somewhat enjoy the process of discovering the interesting guiding principles along the way, or building wisdom one could say.\n\nAnyway, one of the questions of extremes I have been trying to find the balance between in 2020 is whether to work on inspiration or on a schedule. Of course, given my perspective above, I disagree with the premise of the question as it is posed since I do not believe the right answer is purely one or the other. I believe both working on inspiration and on a schedule each have their own merits justifying employment for at least some of the time, but it is difficult to know when each is most appropriate and how best to strike a balance. \n\nThe primary benefit of working on inspiration is obvious. When one is inspired, one tends to do good or great work relative to one’s own standards of performance. There is a reason we think of great art as products of inspiration and commonly refer to athletes having a great games as “inspired performances”. People mix the concept of inspiration with that of motivation and drive and in this way inspiration may be at the root of most or all of our work if it is to be considered broadly enough. Regardless, it is generally accepted that sincere inspiration leads to great work, and so acting on inspiration at least some of the time would seem to make good sense for a person who desires to do great work.\n\nThe primary benefit of working on a schedule may be less obvious though the practice is more popular. Consider how much of most people's days are spent on some semblance of a schedule. Think about how many people you know who work from 9-5 on weekdays or on certain scheduled shifts. Even around these working schedules which comprise the majority of people’s waking days, most also implement additional schedules of some sort, either explicitly or in practice. For example, a person might workout on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday or make breakfast at the same time every morning or read or watch TV around the same time every night. On the weekends, we make plans. Of course, some people live more spontaneously, leaving more room for acting on inspiration, but subjectively it seems to me that a scheduled life is the far more popular norm of our time.\n\nNo doubt, operating on a schedule can be super beneficial. There is a common sentiment I’ve heard a lot of people share which says that \"showing up is half the battle\". Earlier this year, when for several months I followed my own rule of writing and posting a blog every weekday without fail, I came to recognize clearly the value of simply showing up on schedule. Many days I felt inspired to write (and I do believe there are ways to attract inspiration), but on other days it felt more like a chore or something that I had to do. On some of those days when I did not very much feel like writing and/or did not know what I wanted to write about, I ended up producing some of my best work. Sometimes inspiration came halfway through the writing process so although I was not inspired to write in the first place the piece ended up being truly “inspired” in the end. If one is only writing when one is inspired and one is typically inspired to write on average around once a week, that person might be better served by sticking to a schedule of writing 5 times per week and seeing what happens if they follow it for some time.\n\nSo while there is certainly some value in having some regular scheduling, I think most people’s lives are so heavily scheduled that they would benefit from leaving more room for acting on inspiration. The thing about inspiration is that, unlike a schedule, it cannot be forced. The best ways I have found to design around inspiration are to schedule less, engage in activities which seem to attract inspiration (like walking or reading), and set some ground rules for when one should or should not abandon one’s plan or current involvement to act on inspiration instead. A rule to always act the moment inspiration hits sounds romantic but it is impractical from my perspective and probably unwise anyway. If I am preparing for a podcast and minutes before it is time to record I get inspired to write about one of the subjects I’ve noted for discussion, that is probably not the best time for me to do so. The big benefit of being less scheduled is that there are less moments when it is impractical to act on inspiration. There is plenty of room not only for inspiration to hit, but also to act on it. That said, the extreme of acting only on inspiration may lead to a life of largely doing nothing, and since you’re always doing something, nothing just means nothing significant enough to really identify. Perhaps there is nothing wrong with that, and I wouldn't suggest that there is, but as someone who seeks to do great things, I am considering the question of whether to work on inspiration or on a schedule from a perspective that should resonate with others like me.\n\nAs you might have imagined by my introduction, I do not have a definitive answer to offer on the question of whether to work on inspiration or a schedule. Still, I hope my consideration might be useful for others besides myself who have thought about it before, as well as to others still who may have never considered the question so explicitly. What I can say is that I do believe the optimal path in this instance like many others lies somewhere in the middle of the extremes. A heavily scheduled life may be uninspired where an inspiration-only approach may be unproductive. For those who wish to be both productive and inspired, there must be a sweet spot in the middle ground, and it is up to you to find that for yourself. \n\nI tend to believe that most “productive” work is really just a distraction to make oneself feel good about getting things done. An inspired action which may take only an hour could be more impactful than weeks or even months of drudgery checking off items on one’s to-do list in a highly scheduled sort of job. Even in my writing, had I not abandoned the weekdaily schedule which I mentioned I saw such great benefit from, I may have never given myself enough room in my days to feel inspired to start the podcast. In a somewhat scheduled fashion, I have been aiming to release two podcasts per week, but perhaps that schedule too will one day be relaxed so that inspiration may point me in another direction as well. Perhaps I will get to a place where I have a few things that I like to do like writing, podcasting, and investing, and I can simply spend my time bouncing between them as I am inspired to do one or the other. In 2019, I worked all week on someone else’s schedule. In 2020, I removed everything including my job to leave plenty of room for inspiration and then started adding back some scheduling of my own design. I will continue to operate in between extremes, and hopefully over time get nearer and nearer to perfecting the art, even if I will never get there."}]}

It was hosted by one of the group leaders from the birthright trip that I went on and we had a dozen or so people from the program together in her apartment on the Upper West Side, a couple blocks from the northwest corner of Central Park. We had one guy visit from Israel and another couple of people up from DC so I felt very fortunate once again to live in New York where it sometimes feels like everyone is and everything happens. As I wrote previously about Shabbat, I have come to believe it is an excellent concept when afforded a little flexibility. This first experience only further cemented my perspective. We ate great home-cooked food including challah, vegan curry, and kugel which is like a Jewish version of mac and cheese only a little sweeter thanks to some sugar and cinnamon. We talked about the highlights of our weeks, drank wine and beer, and ate chocolates filled with brandy.\n\nTompkins Square Bagels \\- a long line worth waiting in for an excellent bagel toasted with cream cheese. For such a line, one has to be impressed by the efficiency of their system. We were in and out within 10 or 15 minutes and there must have been 75 people inside. I looked at the several different variations of cream cheese and wondered who was ordering all of them, particularly the cookie dough. My only critique is that they are a little light on the everything seasoning for their everything bagels. That said, I grew up spoiled in terms of bagels having had the locally legendary O’Bagel just a few minutes away from my house in New Jersey. Regardless of particulars, TSB will satisfy a bagel craving any day of the week(end).\n\nJohn’s \\- this neon sign between the blocks where my buddies Will and Harry live has intrigued me for a while. The three of us finally got to going on Saturday night and it was exactly what I had hoped it would be. No frills Italian food with an old-school vibe and excellent service, all conducive to a great time. We started with an order of buratta and an eggplant parm to share, complimentary garlic bread served alongside it. We followed with the Spiedino Mozzarella Romana which was basically a giant mozzarella stick sliced into french toaster stick sized slices and soaked in a butter and anchovies sauce which made the whole thing taste a little fishy and a lot salty, but in a much tastier way than those words might seem to suggest. We also had a penne with mushroom sauce but what sealed the deal was the cheesecake dessert. When it comes to desserts, I usually tend towards chocolate and I will take a tiramisu over cheesecake nine times out of ten. When the service is good, however, I will relinquish my preferences in favor of the waiter’s recommendations and so by that means only I have had my fair share of cheesecakes. John’s cheesecake was the best I have had. It was cakey and chilled and just unbelievably delicious. Our waiter Tony was great all night to the point where we somewhat expected him to bring limoncello shots with the check. Even better, he brought complimentary and generous second pours for the ports we had enjoyed with dessert. Tony told us how everything was made in house except for the ice cream in the tartufo, including the cannolis which were “good” he said, but the ones on the next block at Veniero’s were “great”. That is the kind of humility I like to see at a restaurant.\n\nVeniero’s \\- sure enough, I went and tried the cannoli on Sunday. It was great.\n\nCafé Mogador \\- went out for breakfast with my brother on Sunday before the brunch crowds got out of bed. I love waking up after most kitchens are open but before most people are up on the weekends. There is no better time to enjoy a breakfast out. This Middle Eastern spot on St. Marks served a nice breakfast of eggs, hummus, tabouli, and salad with seasoned pita bread on the side. There was a spicy sauce served also on the side which was tasty if you could handle the kick, which if I could, you probably could too. In many towns, this could be a go to spot for me. Here it is just one of many within a few blocks.\n\nEast Village Pizza \\- grabbed a slice in the late afternoon on Sunday to tide me over until dinner after skipping lunch. I ordered a plain slice but audibled to a margherita when I saw it come fresh out of the oven. The switch cost me a buck twenty-five but I could taste the premium ingredients that I paid for. It was a solid 7 slice held back mainly by its mediocre crust.\n\nMimi Cheng’s \\- great dumplings filled on the spot and served fresh and hot. Six or eight pieces, boiled or pan-fried made for an easy choice of eight pan-fried dumplings for me.\n\n1917 \\- saw this in theaters Sunday night with my brother. I continue to be surprised by the quality of movies that were produced in 2019. I loved Parasite, The Irishman, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and while Joker was hard to love, it was easy to appreciate. 1917 I thought was remarkable in the way that it was filmed seemingly without any cuts. You basically had to pick a point within an almost perfectly seamless transition from one scene to another and guess that there was a cut somewhere in there to try and find one. The acting was excellent from the main two characters to the others with briefer roles including the guy who gives them the flare and the single scene appearing eldest of The Stark Brothers from Game of Thrones. My brother argued that it was a better film than the most natural comparison, Saving Private Ryan. We eventually came to an agreement that, although it may have been better technically because of the quarter century’s worth of technological improvements that the 1917 team had at their disposal, it was not necessarily fair to compare the two overall. That would be like comparing the recent Warriors dynasty to Jordan’s Bulls. They may have dominated the same sport, but the game had changed.\n\nI hope people stay healthy this week and that the warm weather today is here to stay."}]}

Naturally, it is called Coin of Jake. The currency's symbol is $JAKE.\n\n$JAKE is for me and the community I am building with your help through this blog, my podcast, my Twitter, and perhaps other means in the future.\n\nThe concept of creating a currency is quite novel, so I expect people will have a number of questions about what it is and how it works. I cannot answer all of them at this extremely early stage, but I can address a few things up front.\n\nJust as Bitcoin has a finite maximum supply of 21 million BTC, Coin of Jake has a finite maximum supply of 10 million $JAKE. That is to say, there will never be more than 10 million $JAKE in the world. It has a certain scarcity by definition, which tends to be a valuable intrinsic characteristic.\n\nWhile there is currently no means by which one can buy $JAKE, there are and will continue to be many opportunities to earn it. Because Twitter is better suited for the purpose of facilitating opportunities to make $JAKE at this point in time, the majority of these opportunities in the beginning will be offered by me there.\n\nIn the near future, $JAKE will be listed on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange where people can go to buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies, soon including $JAKE. After it is listed, the market will determine the value of a $JAKE. In the beginning, I am thinking about $JAKEs like dollars but ones which I have a lot more of than actual dollars, enabling me to incentivize some value-creating earn opportunities among a number of other actions by people who want to make $JAKE. The tweet below was one of the very first examples of this from yesterday. If you read through the replies, the quality and quantity of them tells me that this was a great first step. One could learn a surprising amount simply by reading all of the responses to this tweet and the articles which people linked to along with them. Fundamentally, I do not think the responses would have been of nearly as high quality nor quantity without $JAKE, and so it is already creating value which would not otherwise exist.\n\nI have always been interested in discovering undiscovered talent. To some degree, some of my earliest supporters believe that I currently fit that description. My intentions with $JAKE are to reward these people for their early belief in and support of all that I am doing, and to use this currency to create value for those people, for the world at large, and for myself.\n\nSince this would be somewhat of an unprecedented accomplishment if done in the long-run, I of course cannot make any promises. I certainly do not want people to go buy a bunch of $JAKE and lose money which of course is always possible with any asset, especially one as speculative as this will be in the earliest days of its evolution. I want to be clear that I cannot guarantee that this will work by any means, but I sincerely believe that it will. I believe in myself, and although it will be as much up to all of you as it will be up to me, I will do my best to make $JAKE a success.\n\nThe link below will allow you to own a stake in $JAKE. Consider it a literal token of my appreciation, a small piece of equity in this community.\n\n[URL] (If you are reading this past a certain point in time, all $JAKE will already have been claimed via this link. Email me or send me a DM on Twitter and I will give you your first $JAKE.)\n\nYour first $JAKE is free to redeem and will be held in the wallet of the account that you will create on Roll. For those who are more familiar with crypto or plan to be in the future, $JAKE can be transferred off of Roll to any ETH Wallet as you please. For those who have already claimed their first $JAKE from my original introduction on Twitter or one of the opportunities to make $JAKE that has been offered thus far, you can still use the link above to add to your balance. Let's just say it pays to both follow me on Twitter and subscribe to my blog.\n\nAlready, well over 100 people own a stake in $JAKE. Soon there will be more than 1,000. I believe there is great potential in the possibilities for this growing community, and I am excited to see what happens. This is only just the beginning. As always, I appreciate your ongoing support.\n\n\\- Jake"}]}

Actually, he bought two of them. They were not extraordinary pizzas by any means. In fact, they were two large pizzas from Papa John's.\n\nLaszlo was determined to make the very first Bitcoin transaction, and he did. He found someone online who agreed to facilitate the delivery of two Papa John's pizzas to Laszlo's house in exchange for a cool 10,000 Bitcoins. When the pizza delivery took place in 2010, those 10,000 Bitcoins were worth about $40 in total. Today, 10,000 Bitcoins would be worth about $100 million. That is just over $6 million per slice.\n\nI would not feel too sorry for Laszlo. I imagine he held onto some Bitcoins and is doing just fine.\n\nSome people believe Bitcoin already had its big boom in 2017 when it climbed to a price that was about twice as high as it is today. Others believe this is still the beginning.\n\nLet me say that I will not be buying any pizzas with Bitcoin any time soon.\n\nFor anyone interested in reading a fundamentally informative perspective on Bitcoin from a highly respected investor, I recommend this recently released letter from Paul Tudor Jones. You can skip to start at the \"Seeking Refuge\" section header at the bottom of page 4 for the part about Bitcoin. I really enjoyed it."}]}

The site defines Rt as \"the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person. If Rt is above 1.0, the virus will spread quickly. When Rt is below 1.0, the virus will stop spreading.\"\n\nBelow you will see 4 charts from the site. Each chart shows the Rt figures for every state (+ Washington DC). These charts show the respective statuses of each state at the mid-point of each of the last 4 months, beginning with the chart from April 15th and ending with the chart from today.\n\nApril 15:\n\nMay 15:\n\nJune 15:\n\nJuly 15:\n\nIt does not take a data scientist to see that the way things have trended this summer does not bode well for America in terms of the virus. Of course, all of this data is meaningless if we cannot trust the methods of collection, calculation, and presentation to be reasonably sound. I tend to trust them as of today based on the website and those I have seen cite it but admittedly I have not done as much of my own diligence as I would need to authoratatively argue that you should do the same. Still, I do not feel irresponsible in sharing my personal view as long as I am clear in expressing that it is only that.\n\nI also want to share an update on my personal level of caution in regards to the virus, such that it may be helpful to someone else's thinking about determining their own. In the last month, I have started golfing with friends (in separate and sanitized carts or walking), going to Lauren's house some weekends, and I am driving up to Cape Cod to hang out with two of my best friends one of whom I have not seen since I left San Francisco in late 2018. I am comfortable taking these calculated risks because I believe my level of caution is probably in the 80th or 90th percentile nationwide and I figure that gives me and my family (which is acting similarly) a very low chance of getting a virus which has so far infected about 1 in 100 Americans. I am comfortable enough with the product of that small chance and the also small chance that anyone in my family would have a very severe case if we did get it, let alone in the worst case scenario, a fatal one.\n\nNo decision that involves the possible outcome of premature death is an easy one, even if it is a 1 in many thousands chance. Another thing I am concerned about less than death but more than having a bad virus for a few weeks is the possibility of any lasting damage from acquiring the virus because I have seen next to nothing conclusive on the subject. These are not easy decisions we are making, and as such they are ones that most people try most of the time not to think about, myself included to some extent. It is easier to simply decide your rules (or lack thereof) and abide by them until something forces you to change your mind. Still, it is important to recognize that this is a dynamic disease that will not die soon and so it is worth checking in with yourself once every couple of weeks or month at least to re-evaluate the state of play, re-consider what you are doing, and ask yourself if you are taking too much risk or if you can afford to ease up a little on a couple of risk-increasing activities that you most would enjoy and not want to miss.\n\nIn most cases, when choosing between a safe option and a less safe one, I have a hard time imagining a situation where I would ever regret doing the safe thing. The safe thing is often easy and the less safe thing is often tempted by laziness and resistance to change more than it is by a strong desire to do that thing. That is why I usually end up on the safe side.\n\nAt my house we are still getting groceries online because it is just or almost as good as going to the store (I actually think it is better). We are not going many places very often and are using masks anywhere inside when we do because it is easy and it is safer so why not? I am generally taking every precaution outside of the few exceptions that I named above which involve doing a few of my favorite things with a few of my favorite people.\n\nI understand the people who argue against living in fear. I also understand the people who cannot understand those people. There is not enough understanding these days by people on either side of people on the other. This is an unprecedented time for everyone alive and the best we can do is the best that we can. We don't all need to agree on everything.\n\nI personally am choosing to remain careful with COVID. I have a hard time imagining a future where I would regret it. Some days are tough, sometimes for no good reason, but on the average day I can make the best of it."}]}

This is the standard route that I have run along a few times every week since coming back to New Jersey at the beginning of social distancing in New York, the day after most of my friends companies went remote, which was the same day that I had plans to go to the Big East Tournament at Madison Square Garden. Fortunately, we decided not to go. Those of us that planned to go ended up getting together for drinks in the East Village and watching the games on TV. We decided not to go after news broke that March Madness would be played without fans but we did not yet know that the NBA season would be suspended later that night, that March Madness would be cancelled completely the next day, and that the games we were watching that night would be the last televised basketball games for a long while. I am grateful that we decided not to go to what was probably the largest gathering of people that night in what has now been recognized as the most infected city in the world and was probably well on its way to becoming so at that point. I had written weeks prior about my level of concern for how the coronavirus could develop, and my concern itself had begun to develop weeks before I decided to write about it, but it was my idea to buy tickets for the games that night and ultimately my decision to pull the plug on the plan at the 11th hour. The lesson, if there is one, is to trust your gut and to act in accordance with your beliefs even if they are different than those of most of the people around you, even if they are different than what the mainstream media is saying, or what the the president is tweeting, or what the World Health Organization recommends. Of course, this is not a flawless rule that applies in all situations and it does not mean that you should disregard social distancing guidelines just because most people and organizations are now on board with them, but if your beliefs seem to be more responsible, conservative, and/or safer for you and others, and if you have a lot of conviction in them, then go with your gut. Fortunately, though I take full responsibility for initiating the issue in the first place, I was able to resolve it by going with my gut in the end.\n\nAnyway, back to that run that I mentioned, I usually stop one tenth of a mile before my driveway as that is when the mileage tracker on my phone says that I have hit 3 miles on the dot. Today, as I walked from that point to the driveway, I walked over two wires that I had never walked over before. The wires, laid a foot or two apart from and parallel to each other, were nailed into the road and connected at the end to a brick-sized plastic box with a logo on it that said \"MetroCount\". The box was attached to a white-painted wooden sign on the side of the road that says \"entering\" on the top line, and the name of my township below it. The sign was permanent and I had seen it thousands of times before but the box and the wires were new and today was the first time I had seen them. Between the newness and the placement of the box combined with the name that was on it, it was not difficult to surmise that this was a system installed yesterday to track the traffic in and out of my township, I assume, to measure adherence to social distancing orders which in New Jersey mandate working from home for non-essential businesses and restraining from non-essential travel. I could be wrong about any of that, but it does not so much matter as I am only bringing it up as a means by which to write about something more important than the number of cars going in and out of my small and rural New Jersey township each day.\n\nThe thing that I want to touch on today is how we are going to emerge from the quarantined state that we are in today as a country. The first thing that I think is important to note is that we may not emerge from it as a completely united country at all. Rather, we may emerge from it as a collection of potentially less united states. Governor Gavin Newsom has gotten into a somewhat frightening and potentially foreshadowing habit of referring to California as a \"nation-state\" recently. At least 15 states have now placed travel restrictions on Americans coming in from other states and it seems probable that most of the rest them will follow suit. There is even one North Carolinian county that is ironically called \"Dare County\" which is not letting anyone in without a permanent residency entry permit, so things could go further in that direction too. Different states and counties will come up with different approaches and solutions because they are comprised of different demographics and governed by individuals and groups with different perspectives on how best to mitigate this crisis and eventually emerge from it. There will be overlap, of course, and hopefully some degree of national leadership but as long as it is every state for themselves it seems more likely that states will social distance themselves right away from each other and away from the whole. If secession was not already a realistic possibility for a large and left-heavy state like California in a scenario in which Trump is re-elected, it sure seems to me to be one now.\n\nThere is another aspect related to the nature of our emergence from this crisis which is arguably more impactful than a situation in which states could go separate ways in their attempts to save their own people's lives and livelihoods. That aspect involves how we handle things from a freedom and privacy perspective using technologies that exist today and which will be developed tomorrow. The MetroCount system that I ran across today seems relatively harmless. As best I could tell from the company's website, the device is counting aggregate vehicles anonymously in terms of traffic into and out of the county via this individual road. That seems harmless, but what if there was also a camera that captured license plates, a system for connecting that license plate to an individual, and a $1,000 dollar fine for anyone who crosses the wires in quarantined townships? That seems like something a lot of people might not like, and I do not believe it is much of a stretch at all. That technology and those systems already exist. That scenario may be controversial but not compared to another scenario in which the wires would be installed at the ends of everyone's driveways, instead of on the roads, and people would be charged a large fine just for leaving their homes. It is not impossible to imagine a situation in which people could be fined simply for googling \"what are the best ways to circumvent driveway wires\". This is no doubt a further out scenario, but compared to the premise of the movie Minority Report in which murderers are arrested and convicted before committing the crime, the concept of being fined based on your Google history seems relatively civil. The key word there is \"relatively\".\n\nWhile it will be important to open the economy back up as soon as is reasonably and responsibly possible, the ways in which we do that in terms of the infrastructure that will need to be built and installed and the policies that will need to be agreed upon and enforced will be very important. As I have written previously, once the defaults are set, human tendencies do not naturally go against them or overturn them, especially when they are very complex. I doubt we will see American law enforcement welding shut doors of apartments to force quarantines, as was reported to have been done in Wuhan, but other non-physical methods of mitigating the virus could be just as, if not more, consequential. Will we have mandatory location tracking on our phones soon and forever? Could we do something similar but make it voluntary even though non-participation probably means more deaths? Could we make it mandatory but temporary and anonymous so that people can be alerted when someone they have been in close proximity to has tested positive, without necessarily needing to know who that person was, and without any central authority needing to know who any of the people are? These are questions that I have not thought about long enough or done nearly enough work on to form an opinion on or propose an optimal solution for. Still, I can appreciate the vast magnitudes of the impacts that these decisions will have on our communities, states, countries, and the world. I hope that leading decision-makers around the world are conscious of how powerful the defaults they set today will remain in perpetuity. I hope that they make the best decisions that they possibly can and that they do so quickly but do not hurry. I am an optimist by nature and by practice and while I am preparing for the worst, I am hoping for the best.\n\nToday, in my township, it started with a MetroCount box. Soon, but not too soon, we will see how it ends."}]}

I am talking to everyone-- white, black, Japanese, Chinese, red, brown. No one is superior to the other. The Only Supreme being is God himself.\n> \n> Please, let's begin to pray for healing for our nation. We are the United States. Have we been united?

He has always told me to work hard and have fun. Accordingly, I have spent a lot of time working hard and having fun. It has been a great way to live so far, and it is one of the many great things I have learned from my dad.\n\nI vaguely recalled writing about this saying in the past and searched my inbox to find a draft essay that I wrote as part of an application to Stanford's Deferred Enrollment MBA Program when I was a senior in college. The program is designed for college seniors who want to get a couple years of work experience before filling their reserved spot in a class of Stanford MBAs. I thought that sounded like a pretty good gig so I applied to both that and to Harvard's version of the same thing. I got rejected by both, applied to Harvard's MBA Program again a couple of years later, and got rejected again. I will aim to freely share my failures and rejections on this blog as they become relevant because I believe they as much as anything else will be the reasons for my success in the end. In the wise words of Norman Peale, \"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.\"\n\nAnyway, today I would like to share with you the drafted essay about working hard and having fun that I once wrote and frankly cannot remember if I eventually submitted or scrapped. I think this must have been the first draft from an initial inspiration because parts of it were not at all proper sentences (I cleaned them up minimally to be readable) and the email says \"Sent from iPhone\". The question that prompted the essay was something along the lines of \"What matters most to you?\", and for whatever it is worth, I would have a different answer today, but the following is still very important to me.\n\nHere was my drafted response:\n\nWhat matters to me most is to work hard and have fun. I would assume that most people have a tough time remembering when what matters most to them started mattering to them at all. For me, it started in Kindergarten when my dad first started driving me to school in the morning on his way to work. When he dropped me off each morning, he would say, \"work hard, have fun\", and off I went to school.\n\nI went to the same school K-8 and this became a daily school drop off tradition. Three years later, when I was starting the third grade, my brother joined the big boys ride to school for the first time. This time, it was his first day of Kindergarten. From then on, it was both of us to whom my dad would say, \"work hard, have fun.\" But the tradition did not last forever.\n\nMy family moved about 20 minutes south from the house that I was born in during my summer before the fifth grade. My dad had already stopped driving us some days because he was splitting time between his old office by our school and his new office by our new home. Now that we moved, my parents told me that we were going to start next year at the local public school, but I loved my school it was the only one I had ever known. I was miserable at my new school and I can almost still feel the uncomfortable feeling I felt those first few days there. I begged and begged my parents to let me go back to my old school and eventually they actually did. I am so lucky for their sacrifices and for generally putting up with me. In my middle school years, my mom would often tell me, \"you know, you're going to grow up to be a great lawyer one day\", which was a nice way of saying \"you are a stubborn little boy.\"\n\nI went back to what I knew and I worked hard, and I had fun, graduated, went to a new school for high school, worked hard, and had fun. College, felt like that other school, just not right, but this time I knew why. I wanted to work hard but my friends here were mostly only having fun. Partly my fault, I tend to befriend the most fun loving people in my environment. I could have easily found hardworking friends at this college, but maybe they wouldn't have had fun, or maybe they would have and I just had a bad start, I don't know, but I wanted out.\n\nMy gap year was really my first experience where working hard and having fun merged into the same thing. I was loving what I was doing most of the time, and most of the time I was working.\n\nI got to my new college and returned to the old model for a year where the two (\"work\" and \"fun\") were pretty separate. I don't think high school or college is very conducive to working hard and having fun at the same time honestly. I was having fun with my friends and my new fraternity, and I was working hard in school.\n\nMy junior year was different. I decided at the beginning of the year I wanted to work hard one semester and have fun the next. I worked insanely hard recruiting for an investment banking internship during the fall and was fortunate to get an internship with the group I will now be joining full-time after graduation, and with my semester of hard work behind me and a summer of hard work ahead of me, I went and had fun. I studied abroad and traveled all around Europe and it was the most fun four months imaginable. It was unimaginable really. It wasn't just fun. It was truly amazing. My walk to school, St. Patty's in Dublin, Spring Oktoberfest in Munich, the baths in Budapest, beaches in Barcelona, biking in Amsterdam. A wine tasting in Tuscany. I don't expect to live that way ever again, and I'm fine with that, I'm just so grateful I got to do it once.\n\nI worked hard that summer. I was the only one in the whole office who was in the office for at least a couple of hours everyday from the first to the last of the internship, including July 4th. I had my fun in the months prior, and this summer was for working hard to get a return offer, so I worked hard and got a return offer. On my mousepad, I wrote in black sharpie a quote from Muhammad Ali, \"Don't count the days. Make the days count.\"\n\nI had fun this Fall, and worked hard, mostly separately, the inevitable balance of college as I said, and I continue to do the same, but working a little harder, having a little more fun, and doing it by doing more things that combine the two, and wasting less time, which to me includes oversleeping.\n\nNow that I'm graduating, I feel it in my gut that it is time to really work hard. I feel it is time for me to begin serving the world. I am tired of my parents and others serving me. I started serving this semester choosing to do my full time internship for my major with Boys & Girls Club. And I'm going to continue to serve, but in the ways that make me feel like my gap year. When I was having fun working hard. That's what I believe I will find at my first post-graduate job, despite the investment banking horror stories, I did it, and I don't have to have fears of stories, I have my own experience to reflect on as an intern being right with the full time analysts, and it seemed like a lifestyle I could enjoy. I will work hard and learn so much about finance and technology, the two things that, industry-wise, matter most to me, because I believe that money runs the world and technology changes it.\n\nI want to come to Stanford for my MBA to meet like-minded people who can have fun working hard like me, and who have aspirations as high as the sky and are inspired, and brilliant, and crazy, and different."}]}

He talked about a number of thought-provoking concepts. One in particular which seems to have garnered attention from listeners is what Balaji referred to as the \"Larry Page Dictum\". The idea is that, in terms of technological improvements, 10x can sometimes be easier than 10%. Balaji describes how changing paradigms can open opportunities for 10x improvements whereas incremental 10% improvements often become increasingly difficult to achieve and have certain limits.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from a 2013 interview in which Page describes why he encourages employees to go after paradigmatic 10x improvements instead of incremental 10% improvements.\n\n> Wired: Google is known for encouraging its employees to tackle ambitious challenges and make big bets. Why is that so important?\n> \n> Larry Page: I worry that something has gone seriously wrong with the way we run companies. If you read the media coverage of our company, or of the technology industry in general, it's always about the competition. The stories are written as if they are covering a sporting event. But it's hard to find actual examples of really amazing things that happened solely due to competition. How exciting is it to come to work if the best you can do is trounce some other company that does roughly the same thing? That's why most companies decay slowly over time. They tend to do approximately what they did before, with a few minor changes. It's natural for people to want to work on things that they know aren't going to fail. But incremental improvement is guaranteed to be obsolete over time. Especially in technology, where you know there's going to be non-incremental change. So a big part of my job is to get people focused on things that are not just incremental. Take Gmail. When we released that, we were a search company—it was a leap for us to put out an email product, let alone one that gave users 100 times as much storage as they could get anywhere else. That is not something that would have happened naturally if we had been focusing on incremental improvements.\n\nLarry Page is not the only billionaire technology entrepreneur who believes competition is overrated and 10x improvements are critical. In his book, Zero to One , Peter Thiel famously stated \"competition is for losers\". He argues that all successful companies are monopolies and that the strongest characteristic of a monopoly is proprietary technology which is at least 10x better than the next best alternative. Thiel and Page also agree on the idea that companies are doomed to decay (in Page's words) and die (in Thiel's) the moment they stop inventing in favor of making incremental improvements on what has worked for them in the past.\n\nJeff Bezos' company sits right above Page's on the list of the 5 highest valued companies in the world. Like Page and Thiel, he too emphasizes the importance of going after 10x technologies. Bezos has said that \"you cannot invent without experimenting\" and that experimental failure is \"the kind of failure you should be happy with.\" He wrote in last year's shareholder letter that \"if the size of your failures isn't growing, you're not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle.\" Below is an excerpt from a previous shareholder letter he wrote in 2015 describing his logic for making extremely ambitious bets.\n\n> Jeff Bezos:Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent change of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten….The difference between baseball and business, however, is baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.\n\nPage, Thiel, and Bezos all appreciate the need-to-have nature of 10x improvements for any company that seeks to sustain lasting success as one of the most valuable organizations in the world. They tolerate strikeouts and encourage swinging for the fences. Without Google +, Fire Phone, or Thiel's failed venture bets, you don't get Gmail, Kindle, and SpaceX. It is no coincidence that Google created the home for moonshots and Bezos and Thiel bet more literally on shooting for the moon. These insanely successful founders owe much of their successes to their independent thinking and contrarianism and yet they have all come to the same conclusion on at least one thing. 10% improvements are the recipes for failure while 10x technologies are the keys to success."}]}

Surprisingly, some seemingly similar countries had totally different percentages (i.e. 4% in Denmark vs. 86% in Sweden). The reason had nothing to do with the drivers and everything to do with the DMV forms. Denmark's form said check this box to become an organ donor. Sweden's form said check this box to \"not\" become an organ donor. Hardly anyone in either country checked the box.\n\nThat is how the word \"not\" on a DMV form led Sweden to have a few million more organ donors than it would have otherwise had with the same percentage of donors as Denmark. Presumably, that incremental number of organs in Sweden saved a great number of lives that were unfortunately and preventably lost in Denmark.\n\nI think it is important to try to be more conscious of the decisions we are making, especially when there is a default option involved. We should strive to fall back on action as much as we do on inaction, checking the box as easily as we don't. Lastly, we should be thoughtful when designing systems and default options for people now and into the future. It could mean the difference between Sweden and Denmark, and that could mean many lives.\n\nI should note, I was fortunate to visit Copenhagen two months ago and came away with the impression that Denmark is an awesome place. This post is obviously not intended to suggest anything otherwise.\n\n[URL]"}]}

It was interesting for me to read again today. Among other things, in the second to last paragraph, I wrote:\n\n\"I sold all of my stocks on the market’s open on Monday (2/24) because I do unfortunately think that the panic if not the reality of the situation will get worse before it gets better. Hopefully I will be wrong, but I would rather be wrong and miss out on whatever market fluctuations may occur between now and when it all blows over than to keep my money in the market for the ride, especially when people have predicted a significant downturn that has yet to come every year for the last few years. \"\n\nThat turned out to be a good move.\n\nToday I have made another move, for the first time since I liquidated my portfolio dipping one cautious toe back into the rapids-like water that is this unprecedentedly volatile stock market. I bought just one share of Amazon, just as I wrote that I would in my post titled Appreciating Amazon last week.\n\nI did not buy stock today because I believe the market has bottomed. Quite the contrary, I strongly believe that the market has a lot further to fall. The S&P 500 as I write this is trading in the high 2,500's which is higher than it was just over a year ago on the first day of trading in 2019. I do not have a fancy model of the macro-economy to show you but my gut is that the S&P 500 will bottom somewhere in the wide range between 1,500 and 2,200. That said, I do not believe Amazon will fall very far with it, and it may in fact rise alongside it with negative correlation.\n\nIf Amazon does fall by x%, I would probably buy 2 more shares, and if it falls by another x% from there, I would probably buy another 2-4 more. I took a similar approach with Tesla in the last couple of years as I think it works well when the short-term is very difficult to predict but the long-term conviction is clear. I am not going to predetermine what x% is but it would probably be somewhere between 15-20%, or maybe a little bit less than that. Two 20% drops from the price I bought it at $1,907 would be $1,526 and $1,220 respectively. I will not be very surprised if it hits that first drop but will be extremely surprised to see it hit the second. On the upside, there is 15% to gain if Amazon simply rises back its all-time high from just a little over a month ago. I do not know whether that will take a few days, weeks, months, or years, but I have very high conviction that it will hit that high again at some point. That is the baseline for my investment and that is why I will buy more at certain points if it goes down. Complimentary to this all-time high theory, I believe Amazon is the most valuable American company in the world and, coincidentally, its market capitalization (public valuation) is just a little more than that same 15% away from the current valuations of Microsoft and Apple above it. For a variety of reasons, I am very confident that Amazon's value has yet to hit its all-time high for, let's just say, the next few years, a period for which I would be willing to hold my investment if need be in order to realize that gain. To be clear, in my mind, having to hold Amazon for a few years to recognize a 15% gain is more or less a worst case scenario. I believe it will happen a lot sooner than that, and that the potential upside is much much greater than 15%.\n\nToday, Amazon is trading at about the same level as it was a year and a half ago. In the year before that it doubled after having already doubled over the two years before that. I do not think it would be unreasonable for one to expect it to break out of stagnation and double again in the next couple of years as well.\n\nIn the past, I justified investments in Amazon in the mid to high 1,000's with this same all-time high theory and a supporting hypothesis that the most likely catalyst to a near-term market crash would be the fall of retail and that Amazon would at least benefit from if it did not in fact cause that crash, making it somewhat crash-resistant and a sensible investment for good times or bad. I had absolutely zero idea that the catalyst for that catalyst would be the global pandemic the world is now facing, but the theory stands sound, and that is also a part of why I am investing in Amazon again today.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce businesses and AWS businesses both are the market leaders in their respective rapidly-growing spaces and even with Wal-Mart (domestically) and Alibaba (internationally) battling them in the former and Microsoft and Google battling them in the latter, they seem like the horse to beat in both races. Last week, they announced the hiring of over 100,000 new employees to meet increased demand from the ongoing pandemic and they are now firmly considered a business that we almost if not literally could not live without. I like the way Jeff Bezos makes big decisions and I am in awe of all he has been able to accomplish thus far. The company has done nothing but exceed most people's expectations to date and I have no reason to believe they will not continue to do so in the near-term, when the world will likely need Amazon more than ever. I could go down a laundry list of reasons why I believe in the company and why I believe it is undervalued. If you are looking for a more formal analysis, I liked this one that came out just yesterday from Oleh Kombaiev. Still, none of that is as important to me as my fundamental logic and reasoning for the investment. The bottom line is that I view Amazon as a disproportionately low-risk investment for a probable high reward which I have a great deal of conviction in. I acknowledge that the price at which I bought it may go down but I am prepared to invest more if it does, and possibly even if it does not. I would be very hesitant to buy shares in most publicly traded companies today, but the one I feel most confident about is Amazon. That is why I bought a share of Amazon today."}]}

Well, she was fortunate enough to win the tickets. I am just fortunate enough to date her.\n\nThe guests for tonight were scheduled to be Andy Samberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Finneas, but we were told upon arrival that there would be a surprise guest in addition that everyone was going to love. After much time guessing who it would be, Lauren’s friend hoping it would be Billie Eilish (Finneas’ better known sister), her friend’s boyfriend and I hoping it would be someone from the Super Bowl last night, Elon Musk, or Margot Robbie (who is on the schedule for tomorrow), and Lauren hoping it was going to be Brad Pitt after Jimmy showed a pre-recorded bit that they did for the show, the surprise guest was revealed to be none other than RuPaul, who is not only the most famous drag queen in the world, but as he/she corrected Jimmy on the show, “the queen of drag”. So much for Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThe top three moments for me were the beginning monologue, Andy Samburg’s buddy from The Lonely Island eating a raw T Bone steak a few seats to the left of us as part of an act, and Jimmy walking through the crowd to do some unrecorded Q&A during one of the breaks. The Roots were on point as expected beginning with Express Yourself and the performance from Finneas (as well as his interview for that matter) surprised in a good way. I am going to check out some more of his music this week.\n\nI was most surprised by the number of lights, the largeness of the cameras, and the hidden door in the waffle wall behind the couch area through which Jimmy would exit the stage between segments.\n\nI used to watch the show quite a bit when Jimmy first took it over from David Letterman but other than that I have never been much of a late night talk show guy, or any time or type of talk show guy really. Nonetheless, being a part of the audience was a thrill and an experience that I would highly recommend entering yourself in the lottery to win if you are near the New York City area.\n\nI have been a fan of Jimmy’s since the movie Fever Pitch , the underrated romantic comedy that took an unscripted turn when the Red Sox ended up breaking the curse and winning The World Series that year. I remember I happened to visit Boston for a Sox game with my dad that summer and there was fake snow in the streets in August for the purpose of the film.\n\nWe all really enjoyed the show and Jimmy certainly does a great job hosting it. If you happen to watch it tonight, you might see us a couple of rows back in the middle. I was in a grey sweater, probably clapping and trying to figure out which camera to look at."}]}

If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day.\n\nWe are going the wrong way.\n\nBernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn't it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidates are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.\n\nIn terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a study in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).\n\nThere are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person's 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.\n\nPolitics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).\n\nIt is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.\n\nHere are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:\n\n   Microsoft's Satya Nadella (52)\n\n   Apple's Tim Cook (59)\n\n   Amazon's Jeff Bezos (56)\n\n   Alphabet's Sundar Pichai (47)\n\n   Alibaba's Daniel Zhang (48)\n\n   Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg (36)\n\n  * Tencent's Ma Huateng (48)\n\n\n\n\nThe median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading both of those efforts.\n\nThe point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team's quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn't mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40's to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America."}]}

It's not a big deal. I just like improving things. Music is a pretty fundamental thing.\n\nIt came to my attention this morning that my music listening could use some improvement. I'm basically listening to the same songs all the time. Eventually, I get sick of them. Then I find new ones, and I get sick of those too.\n\nI love music -- all sorts of it -- and I know what I like when I hear it, but I don't like how I end up listening to the same few songs or artists essentially on repeat. I know that this is probably because I have not had a great system. In terms of platform, I've used Spotify for a few years. Before that, I used Tidal (I like Jay-Z and at some point in 2016 it was the only streaming service where you could play Kanye's The Life of Pablo). I imagine I could create a great system on Spotify, Apple, or Tidal, so I doubted the problem was the platform. I figured the problem probably had more to do with the way I was using it.\n\nSo I wanted to change the way I was using Spotify. The basic objective was to make it easier for myself to listen to more new music (as in new to me, not necessarily recently released), better music, and significantly more variety. I would need to change something in order to make this happen.\n\nI figured the best approach would be to create some radio stations on Spotify and make them easily accessible on mobile. That way, I would be able to see a handful of options and just press play. I tried that with playlists in the past but it hasn’t worked mostly because those get stale too. I’ve had success with radio stations in limited use, so I noted this as a to-do while on a walk: \"▪️Make radio stations on Spotify\".\n\nWhen I got back and went to redesign my Spotify, I first wanted to check if there was a different template available for the home view, or if it was configurable in any way. After checking \"Settings\" with no luck, I went back to the home screen and pressed a “music” button in the top left that I can't recall pressing before. Then I saw this new “DJ” feature labeled “beta”.\n\nI pressed the DJ button and an AI named Xavier introduced himself and told me he was going to be my new personal DJ. He sounded like a real person and said he knew what I liked and everything I’d ever listened to. Without any further adieu, he intro’d Gimme Shelter by The Rolling Stones and faded it in while he finished talking over it like a good old-fashioned radio host.\n\nIt was a pretty surreal moment, honestly. Music is meaningful, and this felt like a meaningful moment for music. I thought to myself \"OK, this is great, I’ll try this and can setup the radio stations later\". Then I realized how dumb of a thought that was. Forget the radio stations! This was a better solution to my problem than I could have possibly imagined. Here was this brand new AI DJ that I didn't even know existed, still in beta, in the midst of an AI revolution. It felt like this thing (\"Xavier\") was sent here to bring better music into my life, one song at a time, at the exact time that I realized I wanted to start listening to some better music.\n\nI’ve been listening to the DJ while writing this actually. It’s great. It’s totally personal. It’s easy. It's automatic. It feels like the future.\n\nFrom this seemingly narrow experience, I realized a more general takeaway. I want to get better about being more open to unforeseen, often unimaginable solutions. Moreover, I want to get better at letting go of solutions I may have had in mind at a given time in favor of these unforeseen solutions that present themselves, especially when the latter are better.\n\nIn this case, I wanted a better system for better music. I thought the solution was radio. It turned out to be AI. Still, before the first song had even finished, the concept of creating radio stations popped back into my brain as an eventual to-do. I realized how dumb that was and let it go. Solutions to solved problems are no longer needed! Forget those previously-thought-to-be-good-idea-now-redundant-and-unnecessary to-do’s. Forget the radio and embrace the DJ. When the solution comes to you, there's nothing left to do!"}]}

Generally, the California weather is great, but I would argue that, regardless of each season’s individual worth, it is the combination of the four and the transitions between each that give them value. Post- New Year’s winter is the only part I could probably do without. I think I’d like to spend those two or three months in LA some day.\n\nOn the subject of seasons, “Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter … and Spring” is a great movie that I recommend but only for people who seek films that are unpopular and unusual and give them a chance. You must be open to sub-titles at a minimum as this movie requires them. I will quote Roger Ebert rather than describing it to you myself:\n\n“The South Korean film “Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter … and Spring” (2003) is Buddhist, but it is also universal. It takes place within and around a small house floating on a small raft on a small lake, and within that compass, it contains life, faith, growth, love, jealousy, hate, cruelty, mystery, redemption … and nature. Also a dog, a rooster, a cat, a bird, a snake, a turtle, a fish and a frog.”\n\nLastly, Ebert’s fully filterable “Great Movies” section on his website (linked below) is an outstanding tool for finding a great movie to watch. I typically sort by highest rated and filter for after 1990, though sometimes I go earlier.\n\n[URL]"}]}

The sun was hot and the streets were dry. Well, mostly. There were still some puddles leftover from the rain last night. A car drove through one of them and splashed me on the sidewalk. It got me pretty good. \n\nI took my next step and kept walking. There was not a stutter in my stride. \n\nI noticed that I was more than a little bit wet, but only from the waist down, and only on my right side. I did not turn around to see the car that splashed me. I was not at all angry or upset. In fact, the first emotion that I recognized was surprise. I was surprised that, now a few steps past the place of the splash, I had not had any reaction. This seemed unusual, hence my surprise. \n\nI became curious. I wondered why I did not react. Then I stopped wondering. It did not seem to matter why I didn’t react, but it did seem to be good that I didn’t. Negative reactions do not seem positive or productive. I don’t think anyone reacts to being splashed by a car by jumping for joy. So, in this case, the best reaction seemed like no reaction. That was my reaction, or lack thereof.\n\nWhy should I have been upset anyway? Ten minutes later, I was completely dry. Why should I have turned around to see who did it, or to yell at them, or to make arms to show my displeasure, or to make them feel bad? It was almost certainly an accident. If they noticed what they did, they probably felt bad already. What good could come from me getting mad? I couldn't think of any. \n\nI did not need to be mad. They did not need to feel bad. It was just water. I kept walking."}]}

They defeat cities and defeat men.\n\nIt is our very preoccupation with occupations that stops us from noticing its own nature.\n\nThe occupied man does not seriously consider the possibility of living without an occupation any more than the man born into a city that has been occupied for centuries considers that it must not be so forever.\n\nWe are blinded by a bias which believes the present will persist. We fail to imagine a future that is radically different, though that is what has happened over and over again, decade after decade, by a degree which has been dramatically accelerating over the course of the last century.\n\nWe view automated industry almost exclusively as a threat while ignoring the opportunity that comes along with it. Automation may offer the potential to free ourselves from our occupations through the automated and automatic satisfaction of our most essential human needs. Such a standard would free us from necessarily having to do anything while simultaneously empowering us to do almost anything.\n\nWe have little gratitude for the generations of humans who have succeeded collectively in driving us to this defining moment in the unfathomably long but universally short history of humanity. We fail to appreciate even those alive today who are pressing us forward faster than ever, choosing instead to nitpick flaws and cancel the courageous. These brave leaders know that we are close. They consider this time the luckiest ever to be alive, and so do I.\n\nPeople fear the new world because it is so different from the one we have known and that any generation before us has ever known. Those who have gained power in this long era of history will not willingly give their power away. They will fight in an effort to delay the disruptive forces but they will fail to realize that while their power over others will be taken away so too will the power of others over them.\n\nWhy should we all be satisfied with living in the middle of this chain of occupations where our lives are seized so that we may seize the lives of others and so that we may use our monies not to free ourselves from seizure but rather to seize possession of mostly meaningless goods and services which only serve to ensure the continuance of our dependence on our occupations as our growing wants overshadow our modest needs and the margin between the earnings we sell our lives for and the expenses we feel obligated to incur becomes ever narrower.\n\nSome will read this and criticize me for being privileged, young, and ignorant. I cannot help but that I am the first two of these things. As for the third, is ignorance not at least as good to admit as certainty is to claim? Is it not as worthwhile to consider my opinion as it would be that of a disadvantaged old man who is certain of everything he knows? My privilege, youth, and ignorance may have assisted me in recognizing these truths but that does not mean that others less fortunate than myself cannot also recognize them and seek to apply them in their own lives however they may.\n\nWe cannot all escape occupation overnight, but we can recognize our preoccupation with occupations, and we can begin to think differently such that there may be another way to live."}]}

Seasonal living is a term I came up with to describe a way of life that involves different ways of living throughout different seasons of the year. This can be, but does not need to be, exactly aligned with the standard seasons -- Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.\n\nFor example, teachers and athletes live seasonally by default. They have school-years and summers, seasons and off-seasons, respectively. Another simple example of seasonal living is the \"snowbird\", the typically wealthier, typically older, warm weather enjoyer who lives most of the year somewhere near New York but spends their winters in Florida or California.\n\nAnother self-made term which goes hand in hand with seasonal living is polyresidence -- having more than one place you call home. Currently, it's hard to do unless you're wealthy enough to pay for two places at once. That doesn't mean it can't be done more economically. It's just harder. For example, if you have a 12-month lease or you own a home, you have to find a way to sublet it out while you're away, unless you want to pay double rent. Alternatively, you can do the whole digital nomad thing, but to me that feels more like no homes than many. I don't want to be constantly on the move right now. I've already enjoyed seasons of that. I just want to live where I want to live, when I want to live there, affordably.\n\nWhat I am looking for, fundamentally, is the best possible way of living. I am not talking about some pareto superior way of living that would be objectively optimal for everyone. That does not exist. I am simply talking about the most preferable way for me to live personally. I expect that to evolve over time, and I don’t ever expect it to be perfect, but I’m someone who believes I can always do better. So in terms of the way that I live, I believe it can always get better.\n\nThere are few things that impact your life as much as where you live – perhaps your relationships (partner, family, friends), your work, your health, and your wealth. There's not much else. Where you live includes a lot of layers – it’s your country, state or region, city or town, neighborhood, street, and of course, your home itself. We live in a world of abundant options – some might argue too many options, but great freedom brings great opportunity.\n\nThe sudden, step-function shift to remote work that resulted from the pandemic gave tens of millions of people the final and critical chunk of freedom they needed to increase their options for living by many orders of magnitude. We newly remote knowledge workers are no longer obligated to attend an office. This means we do not need to live in the one specific place where our office is located. Moreover, it means we do not need to live in one specific place at all. That single, fundamental, commonly-assumed-to-be-unchangeable constant of living near where you work has become a variable for many more than it was before.\n\nThe ability to live anywhere is obvious. The general trend favors more rural, lower cost-of-living locations, while cities like SF & NY try to stop the outflows of enterprising emigrants. The less obvious part is that you can do more than simply switch the location of your single home -- you can have multiple homes, with multiple locations. We just don't have great infrastructure to facilitate that in an economical fashion. Instead, we have traditional mortgages, 12-month leases, no sub-lease policies, digital nomadism, and Airbnbs. But I don't want an Airbnb. I want to live seasonally.\n\nFor some context, I'm 29-years-old. I’ve lived in New York, San Francisco, Miami, Philadelphia, Nashville, and New Jersey, all for at least a year. I’ve lived for at least a month in Charleston, Savannah, Brooklyn, some small towns in Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee, and my favorite, Florence, Italy. I took a road-trip across the country from New York to California, spent a few weeks in Japan doing the nomadic thing, and spent a semester abroad traveling Europe. I’ve seen a lot of places and a lot of ways of living and I decided I don’t want just one of them. I want a few of them, every year, plus some time to try some new ones. I also don’t want to be traveling all the time. I want a home. No, I want three homes. Call me crazy -- I want three homes for the price of one.\n\nIn my ideal world, right now, I would spent 6 months in Miami (November through April), 3 months by a beach in the northeast (June through August), and the remaining three months (May, September, October) between New York, visiting family and friends, and traveling. I don’t know how that sounds to you (of course, you’ll have your own version), but that sounds absolutely heavenly to me. That's the way I want to live. And I’m working on it.\n\nI'm working on a project with my friend Matt who shares a similar perspective. We are starting by launching a newsletter called The Subletter. Our initial focus is facilitating sublets. More broadly, we are building a community of practical idealists (like us) who believe there are better ways to live.\n\nQuite simply, we want to help people live the way they want to. We want to help people travel more and for longer without having to pay a devilish double rent. We want to let snowbirds fly, decades before they become wealthy enough to buy multiple homes. We want to help people have three homes for the price of one! We believe we can do better than 12-month leases and landlords. We seek to live sovereignly, seamlessly, and seasonally.

More and more, it seems like people are going outside again. I spent the majority of my days this weekend down at the pond, my favorite place to be outside. I read a lot about the climate while enjoying its present state.\n\nWithout any further ado or anything extemporaneous, here is the weekend review which I call The Weekend Miscellaneous.\n\nRecords runs - My typical weekend runs were not necessarily typical this weekend. The long run on Sunday was my longest ever, 15 miles, and not particularly painful. I rather enjoyed it for the most part. The short run on Saturday was set to be my typical three miler. I should note that up until several months ago, I considered 3 miles to be a long run as I usually ran just one or two. That was until my buddy Eric convinced me I should slow down, go further, and consider 3 to be a short run. That is the way I have looked at it ever since October when we started running together in Japan. (Thanks, Eric.) Perspective is everything. Anyway, my short run Saturday was briefly interrupted soon after the two-mile mark. I felt something hit the back of my throat and before I could process that it was a bug I had already reacted by swallowing it. My first thought was \"OK, good protein.\" My next thought was, \"Is this thing still in my throat?\". My third thought was, \"It's probably still alive.\" That was when I realized this was going to end with a puke. I held it down for a moment in order to avoid upchucking in front of a passing vehicle. Then I pulled over next to a bush on the side of the road and threw up in someone's front yard. Rather than inspect my own vomit to confirm the presence of the bug, I decided to assume it was in there, got back on the road, and finished out my last mile. It ended up being the fastest 3 miles I have ever run.\n\nBooks on the Climate Crisis - I read a new book called Facing the Climate Emergency by Margaret Klein Salamon on Saturday. Sunday, during my run, I listened to the audio version of What We Know About Climate Change by Kerry Emanuel. I felt that both books were well done, but with different objectives and for different audiences. Margaret's book was primarily a call to action. As a former psychologist, she urges her readers to face the truth of the climate crisis, welcome the fear and negative feelings that come with it, and choose to confront those feelings directly instead of pushing them away or escaping them. She closes the book by suggesting a multitude of ways by which people can and should join the climate emergency movement. In an evidently different approach, Kerry's book sought to provide a clear and straight forward summary of the facts. I found it to be tremendously informative. Secondarily, it can be useful as an outline for how to think about the climate crisis and how to calmly discuss it with anyone who denies the facts of the matter. As both an MIT professor of meteorology and a political conservative, Kerry seems to provide as close to an unbiased representation of the facts as I have found. As is suggested by the title, he writes about \"what we know\", but also, just as importantly, what we do not know. He writes about the degree to which many aspects of climate change fall somewhere in between those two extremes because the system is so complex that, while some direct impacts are known, the more indirect impacts are difficult if not impossible to predict. Kerry's book was better for me personally but I cannot say for sure whether I would have proceeded to read it had I not read Margaret's book first. Perhaps they both served their proper purpose. The contrast in approach between these two books reflects that which exists within the movement to counter climate change itself. There are efforts to recruit versus efforts to inform and it seems that both will be necessary in driving the appropriate level of attention and urgency to this matter of global significance. I plan to continue spending a good deal of time reading and writing about this issue which it seems will inevitably define the development of the future in our lifetimes and, if left unresolved, in the lifetimes of our children and theirs to follow.\n\nBrody's ashes - I am not sure whether I have mentioned my old dog on the blog before. His name was Brody. Brody was a Wheaten Terrier. He passed away last summer at the old age of 16. He would not so much as sit or stay unless a treat was involved, but I am biased to say that he was a good boy. We took his ashes and spread them outside in the field where he used to bark at our neighbor's horses. He once broke through the electric fence and got over to where the horses were to chase one of them around as he had been barking to do for years. I must have been in middle school at the time. When I heard a frenzy of yelling outside, I ran upstairs from the basement. I got outside just in time to see Brody hanging onto the running horses tail. He promptly received the full horsepower of a kick in the head. Brody was bleeding out of his mouth and we feared the kick might kill him but my parents brought him to the animal hospital and he turned out to be just fine. The place where Brody most loved to bark and rebel against calls for him to come back in the house seemed to be the most fitting place for his ashes. We spread them in the field and they flew away in the wind. It was nice. Everyone spread some with the bag and I took a pinch and threw it too and rubbed the dust between my fingers. I washed them off with water. Brody's ashes were free."}]}

Our Stone Age ancestors took shelter in trees and caves. Later, they built their own shelters from sticks and stones, animal hides and bones, and eventually, clay bricks made of dried earth.\n\nFast forward several thousand years and most of us spend nearly all of our time inside. Watching the first half of the Jane Goodall Hope program last night reminded me that our nature is to be outdoors. The monkeys that were born in cages were fine in cages. That was all they ever knew. It was only once they were moved to an outdoor sanctuary that they realized there was another way to live. It was outside. It was natural. It was better.\n\nOf course, I am not suggesting that humans should return to living in trees and caves. I do, however, believe that we would benefit from spending a whole lot more time outside than we currently do. One benefit that I foresee resulting from this ongoing pandemic is that we will.\n\nThe problem is not that we do not want to go outside. Our modern systems are simply not set up for it. Our beds are inside. That is one thing that probably makes sense to keep the same, but we only spend about 8 hours in bed. There are still 16 hours left in every day. Most people spend another 8 hours or so, 5 days out of the week, in schools or offices. Our schools and offices are totally inside, but do they really have to be? Remember the days of late May and early June in school when the wishes of the students won the kindness of the teacher who agreed that they could all have class outside that day? Remember how much better those classes were? What do we need from inside that we do not have outside in order to learn or to work? We have laptops and cell phones. Is one really going to argue that there is no way to build the electrical infrastructure to get a laptop charger to work outside? The extension cord is not a very novel invention. Of course, we will want cover from rain, warmth from cold, shade from sun, and cool air from summer heat, but one hardly ever needs any of those things in a region like Northern California near the likes of Silicon Valley and San Francisco. It is just outside of these major hubs of innovation where I expect the coming movement of going outside will begin. Other regions will be right behind them. Most employees today might be lucky to get 5 or 10 rushed minutes outside just to go pickup some lunch. I believe that will change.\n\nAfter 8 hours in bed and 8 hours at work or school, there are another 8 hours in everyone's weekday. Most of these are in the evening. Outside of the weekday evening hours, there are also about 32 non-sleeping hours that most people have on the weekend. These are the hours when some people already spend some time outside, but still, the systems are not very well set up for it.\n\nMajor gym brands are in trouble and even once they re-open people will not be racing back to them very soon. People might more quickly sign up for an outdoor Equinox with intended-for-outside excercise machines and weights, outdoor yoga classes, and anything else that people might like. The sky would literally be the limit. Restaurants with outdoor seating will see those tables bounce back much more quickly than their indoor seating. Restaurants without it will want to do everything they can do to figure out how to make it work. Most people already ask to sit outside when the weather is nice and the option is available. The added safety of being less at risk of exposure to the virus is only a bonus. Last weekend, I even ran by a church that was hosting Sunday service outside. The priest was at the top of the stairs just outside of the front door of the church. The people stood and sat in front of their cars across the street. It was special to see.\n\nAs humans, we started outside. We will now be going outside again. Perhaps it is possible. Something good will come from all of this bad."}]}

The noise comes from outside of my apartment but is easily audible from within it. It is not just any music. It is what I as a hip-hop fan would categorize as \"gangsta rap\". This is not my favorite sub-category of rap music, especially not at 7:30 in the morning.\n\nNonetheless, my days and I suspect the days of many of my neighbors have often gotten started to the tune of DMX's Ruff Ryders' Anthem. The music is not blaring by the time it reaches the inside of my apartment but if I could choose to hear it or not to hear it, I would certainly choose the latter. One day I got to wondering if the guy playing the music considered the idea that others would be able to hear it too, even outside of his own building (excuse me if I incorrectly assume male gender based on the playlist). I thought about whether he has been conscious of the possible impact he could be having on others and has chosen to play the music anyway, or whether he has been more innocently oblivious to the impact, which could be one that he has simply never thought to consider.\n\nThis morning, I woke up and heard the music, same as always. I got dressed and went for a run along the East River. When I got back to my apartment, I switched my bluetooth connection from my headphones to my speakers, changed what was playing from a podcast to a playlist, and jumped in the shower. I was a couple of minutes in when the first song ended and just before the second song began I heard the words, \"turn down the music!\" After taking a moment to consider whether or not the words were a part of the song I was listening to, I determined that they most likely were not. Someone had timed it to yell between songs so that I could hear them through the window. While I may sometimes be careless, I do try to be courteous. I jumped out mid-shower, turned the music down about 80%, and got back in to wash the shampoo out of my hair. If I was a dog with a tail, it would have been between my legs. I realized in that moment that I was an unconscious offender of the same crime that my gangsta rap neighbor was, only playing a less aggressive song.\n\nHonestly, I had thought about the possible impact of my playing music while I showered once or twice before. I always came to the conclusion that I could continue to play my shower music at what I thought would be a reasonable volume. Admittedly, I probably have played it a bit louder than that on some days, and today was obviously one of those days. With the bathroom window open, the louder than normal music was even further amplified, and I should have thought about the fact that it might be disturbing someone's peace and quiet, but I did not.\n\nFrom here on forward, in an effort not to bother, I will be better about keeping the window closed during my showers and making a more conservative assumption about what low volume of music is a non-bothersome level to play it at. As the botheree (as opposed to the botherer), maybe one day I will go so far as to yell out my window to the neighbor with the evident penchant for gangsta rap.\n\nEveryone makes impacts that they are unaware of all of the time, everyday, sometimes good and sometimes bad. When we notice actions of others that impact us negatively, we should strive to be more conscious when it is possible that we are creating those same negative impacts ourselves. It is because I have sat behind people who lean their seats back on flights when I am eating, for instance, that I am more conscious about putting my seat up when food is served. I should probably keep the seat straight the whole flight if I really want to be a good guy, and sometimes I do, but I am 6'3\" and if the person in front of me leans theirs back I may be a contrarian but I am not totally immune from following the leads of others. I also should probably not be eating the airplane food in the first place, but that is besides the point. The takeaway here, if nothing else, is to be a little more thoughtful about the volume at which we play music in our apartments, especially those of us who live in densely populated cities where several apartments are within earshots of one another. At the very least, we should not be blasting Ruff Ryder's Anthem by DMX first thing on a Tuesday morning."}]}

I first became intrigued by the concept of minimalism years ago after watching a documentary called Minimalism. It was oddly inspiring.\n\nBy the next day, I had cleaned out my closet and filled a few trash bags with clothes for donation. A few things were in bad enough shape that I trashed them. Suddenly, it seemed so stupid that I still kept one of my favorite shirts from high school even though it had a stain on it. Probably pasta oil.\n\nMy methodology for getting ridding of clothes was simple. I made 3 piles. The first was for my favorite things. I knew them well because I wore them often. The second was for the things that I sort of liked or liked a lot but hardly wore. That was the \"maybe\" pile. I took that pile and stored those clothes away and out of sight so that if I thought of something I wanted from it in the next few months, I could go and get it. I might have gone back for one or two things but most of it ended up in the same place as the third pile, Goodwill or the garbage.\n\nI enjoyed my cleaner closet, and for a while, that was the only thing I minimalized. Later, I started getting rid of some more stuff. I had a ton of things that I did not need or use and was not particularly fond of. I did not dislike these things, but I did not particularly like them either. How much can one really love a pencil sharpener on their desk when they haven't used a pencil since high school anyway? And why did I need any pencils, or seventeen pens? I got rid of some things.\n\nA year or two later, I shifted the minimalist perspective to my phone. I deleted all of the apps that I had not used that week, plus a few that I did use but did not want to be using so much. I added them back more thoughtfully as needed over time and only kept a handful of apps on the first screen. I could always swipe over to get to the rest of them, but there was no reason to have the App Store in my face every time I opened my phone when I only needed to download a new app one time in every few thousand uses probably, if that.\n\nGetting rid of non-essential things that I did not explicitly enjoy allowed me to more easily see the things I did like and the surprisingly limited number of things I did need. I did not have nearly as many things to take care of, worry about, put away, clean up, pick up, pack up, or move. As an example of that, I lived in San Francisco for about a year and a half and was able to live in four different places in a few different parts of town because moving my limited possessions was so quick and easy and cheap. I only had to splurge on an Uber XL because of my mattress. When I moved back to New York, I left my mattress behind and moved everything I had with two checked bags and a carry-on. All I had to do was get on the plane. The mobility that is enabled by minimalism is a wonderful type of freedom. That is only one of the many benefits that I have found.\n\nOver time, minimalism has brought me to a place where I have begun to view all of life through a minimalist lens in a way. I have applied it to my subscriptions, my activities, and even my beliefs. Minimalism is not just about getting rid of things. It is about seeing more clearly what you need and what you love and gaining appreciation for those things.\n\nLess is more, if you appreciate it as such."}]}

I like running in the city sometimes as well, but for longer distances it is nice to run without having to weave through walkers, stop at red lights, or get lost following green ones. To get to the East River, there a number of highway overpasses that can be taken to cross over the FDR Drive. When crossing over from E Houston Street, however, the crossing is not an overpass but rather a crossable roundabout with a number of traffic lights and a down ramp on the far side that runs down to the East River parks and running path.\n\nThis morning, I crossed over from E Houston Street and as I got to the ramp and began running down, a dog was running my way with its owner running behind it. This was not a coordinated run between canine and master. This was the canine escaping the master, and running right towards one of the busiest roundabouts in Manhattan. Noise-cancelling airpods still in, I got into a defensive stance and blocked the dogs path, eventually grabbing it when it tried to make its move, and holding it where it was up until the owner caught up.\n\nNow, I do not want to sound too heroic. Whatever dog you may be picturing in your imagination, I am reluctant to admit that it was only one of those small chihuahua-looking things. Still, it might well have been a dead chihuahua-looking thing if I was not turning onto that ramp at the moment that I did, which would have been the case if the traffic lights led me to taking the 5th Street overpass instead of the E Houston St. crossing, or if I did not take the extra minute to take a big empty shipping box down from my 5th floor apartment to the 1st floor garbage area this morning. Today's catching of the dog came down to a lot of luck and a little bit of having some awareness in the moment, as well as a decently imposing defensive stance, mostly due to my size, which is also mostly due to luck. This is a great example by which one can appreciate the butterfly effects of seemingly small and insignificant happenings, which I wrote about previously in my post called \"No such thing as good or bad\".\n\nThis morning I woke up at 7:55, did my fourth day of an introductory meditation series on this new app called Waking Up by Sam Harris (which I learned about through Tim Ferriss), drank a 32 ounce cup of water, wrote a page in my journal, ran 7 miles, listened to this podcast with Laura Deming about extending the human healthspan while I ran, and might have even saved a dog's life. Now I have also written my blog for the day, and it is still just before noon as I finish writing.\n\nI will close with the words that I so often write in my journal to kick things off in a positive way.\n\nToday is a good day."}]}

Currently, I am still using an iPhone 7. I did buy the original Apple Watch only a few months after its release (April 2015), but the only Apple products that I have ever pre-ordered or bought immediately on release have been the Airpods (December 2016) and, more recently, the Airpods Pro (October 2019). I have really enjoyed both versions of Apple’s take on the wireless headphones, but many people view these products as more than meets the eye (resisted the temptation to write “meets the ear”).\n\nI have heard a number of people whose opinions I value predict that the impact of the Airpods will be the most significant of any Apple product since the iPhone. In most cases, the basis of these perspectives relies on a forecast of the future that involves some combination of technological advancement of natural language processing and translation, the improved design, interface, and utilization of voice-activated virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, the emergence of new voice-activated and audio-based applications, the proliferation of voice and audio enabled technology users and growth of overall engagement around the world, and the increase in the supply of audio content that will rise to meet that future demand.\n\nI do not have much insight into the rate of improvement of these technologies though I know some believe that they are at a tipping point. I imagine that is part of what is driving some of the excitement. Nonetheless, while I do not have much of any idea when this future will unfold in some unpredictable form that may look and sound a lot like or unlike what people are predicting, I do believe that people will be talking to technology more and listening to a greater proportion of non-music audio year over year for the next several years, if not the next several after that as well. I also predict that I personally will listen to more non-music audio and do more things through Siri and Alexa in 2020 than I have in all of my past years combined. For now, that is not too high of a threshold to overcome."}]}

They like to point fingers. The left points to Trump and those who support him. The right points to \"the radical left\". I would argue both sides are wrong. I believe it takes two to tango.\n\nIs President Trump less civil in the way he speaks compared with the past presidents in my lifetime? Absolutely. But Nancy Pelosi ripped his State of the Union speech in half on National TV and just yesterday referred to Republicans as \"domestic enemies\". These are not what I would call civil actions. Again, it takes two to tango.\n\nI am writing about this today because this morning I came across a letter that George H. W. Bush (a Republican) left for Bill Clinton (a Democrat) when handing over The Oval Office after losing to him in the 1992 election. That letter (pictured below) reads as follows:\n\n> Jan 20, 1993\n> \n> Dear Bill,\n> \n> When I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that, too.\n> \n> I wish you great happiness here. I never felt the loneliness some Presidents have described.\n> \n> There will be very tough times, made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair. I'm not a very good one to give advice; but just don't let the critics discourage you or push you off course.\n> \n> You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well.\n> \n> Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you.\n> \n> Good Luck --\n> \n> George\n\nThere is no easy answer to solve the apparent divisions which may be new and/or newly surfaced in our country. If there is an answer, I do not believe it will be brought on by a return to the past. I do not believe in going back. I believe in moving forward. Unlike many, I believe we are moving forward. As both a nation and a world, I believe things are getting better. It is just not happening as quickly as many would like, nor according to the priorities that many would prefer.\n\nWhile I am not an advocate for returning to the past, I am a believer in learning from it. I believe this letter from our 41st President to our 42nd offers lessons in civility, sincerity, and respect that could help bring our nation together and further forward if more people were to learn from and live by them. I hope that in future elections I will be fortunate enough to vote for a candidate whom I believe demonstrates these traits, and then some."}]}

The concept is based on the biblical story of Genesis (creation of heaven and earth in six days) in which God rests on, blesses, and makes holy the seventh day.\n\nShabbat begins just before sundown on Friday and ends just after sundown on Saturday. It prohibits 39 categories of activities related to farming, hunting, building, creating, writing, and starting or ending fires. The most common restrictions today relate to electronics and transportation and both are prohibited not explicitly but rather due to the creation of small sparks involved in both activities.\n\nAs its name suggests, Shabbat is intended to be a day for people to spend time with family, friends, and others, and to eat, sleep, read, sing, and pray as they wish.\n\nAlmost none of this I knew before yesterday.\n\nIf it has not been evidently clear, I am not a very observant Jew. I appreciate my ethnicity, but fundamentally I do not believe anyone should be born into a set of beliefs, regardless of what they are. People should have the opportunity to develop their own beliefs, especially in the modern world with such easy accessibility to so many varying perspectives. I do however believe among other things in the power of faith, the practice of discipline, and the abidance by certain principles.\n\nAs such, I would over time like to develop a set of principles to follow that in many ways I believe will looks and feel somewhat like Shabbat. For starters, it will probably be based around Sunday instead of Saturday because that is more naturally aligned with the way weeks work in America and most of the world outside of Israel (where work weeks are typically Sunday through Thursday). Second, I would rethink the prohibitions to align less with the original categories and more with what I believe was their intent which was to prohibit the doing of things that we have to do during the rest of the week. For someone like me, these prohibited activities might include email, use of Microsoft Office or similar applications, and going into an office. Lastly, and importantly, I think the encouraged activities could remain very much the same. The contrast between the continued relevance of these activities as they were initially written versus those that were initially prohibited alone suffices to show the timeless importance of them. Think about how valuable and relevant it remains to spend time with family, friends, and others, and to eat, sleep, read, and practice spiritualism or mindfulness (more broadly than to necessarily sing or pray). Compare that to the modern relevance of one of the prohibited categories, “marking hide”.\n\nI am not quite there yet, but one day I hope to start regularly if not religiously observing a Sabbath of my own. It may look and feel a little or a lot different than Shabbat, but the intention will be similar.\n\nA Jewish friend once told me something that I interpreted as this, “part of Judaism is living by seemingly random rules you do not know the reason for, but you live by them because you have faith in the rule book”. This, I think, is what makes it very difficult for me to have faith in any one religion, though I appreciate various aspects and intents of many of them. \n\nI wrote earlier this week that I would post controversial opinions that I hold today but may change my mind about tomorrow. One of them is that I personally think the prevailing religions across the world are outdated. Many people agree with this but then in abandoning the concept of religion they also abandon all practices of faith. I believe a good future for all peoples of the world will require some sort of faith in humanity."}]}

For many people, it is like a religion. For many more, Bitcoin has a continuous influence on their way of life not dissimilar to other modern systems of belief such as climate change and veganism. To varying degrees, Bitcoin believers will weather potentially any storm (decreases in its value, attacks in the media, etc.). Qualitatively, Bitcoin believers are quite strong.\n\nQuantitatively, outside of Bitcoin’s still relatively small base of believers, there are many more people who do not sufficiently understand Bitcoin than there are people who do understand it but do not believe in it. If the last decade is any indication, a certain and probably high percentage of those who do not yet understand Bitcoin will quickly and easily come to believe in it once they do.\n\nHaving observed these dynamics of the Bitcoin belief system, I am near certain that non-owners are coming to believe in Bitcoin faster than owners are losing their belief. In other words, the outside population is buying into Bitcoin faster than than the inside population is selling out. This trend seems poised to continue indefinitely. As long as it does, so will the appreciation of Bitcoin’s value due to the increasing demand for the limited and finite supply.\n\nOne can think of Bitcoin as having a natural network effect where the owner population is expanding exponentially in comparison with an extremely low churn rate among its existing owners. It is this sort of network effect that has given rise to the most valuable companies of our time. Bitcoin is not a company but it stands to benefit just the same.\n\nQuants can do all the fancy analysis they want but the simple fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is worth nothing without people’s belief in it. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, its value will plummet. If more people start believing in Bitcoin, its value will continue to appreciate. Because Bitcoin’s value is sustained solely by people’s belief in it, it seems to me that any prudent investor who makes a bullish case for Bitcoin should seek to support this most basic underlying assumption which says that the overall belief in Bitcoin is growing and will continue to grow. That is the assumption which I have sought to support with this piece. \n\nIn closing, it is worth stating clearly that money has no real value other than that which people believe it does. As long as people believe Bitcoin is valuable, it will be. Today it seems evident that Bitcoin believers are quickly accumulating and scarcely abandoning the asset. So long as this continues to be the case, and it seems more probable that not that it will, Bitcoin’s value will rise."}]}

Here is what I wrote:\n\nI’ll write about MasterClass. I love the concept but I don’t love the product. In fact, I know more people with negative feelings about it than positive because MasterClass is expensive and people struggle to give enough time and attention to feel they are getting their money’s worth. Worse than the sentiment among those I know who have tried it is the fact that the vast majority of people I know have not tried it at all, and that too is because of price. $180 per year or $90 per class is not an easy commitment, especially if you are young or in debt like most people are, and those are the people we want to be empowering to learn the most.\n\nNonetheless, MasterClass is working anyway, to some degree at least. It has certainly raised a lot of money ($136.4M). It is working because of its teachers and content. MasterClass has an unparalleled lineup of world-class instructors, some of the best in their respective crafts. The content is excellent in terms of both instruction and production quality, but still, I do not believe MasterClass is doing nearly as well as it could be doing to compete for people’s time and attention against the likes of YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, and alike. That is why I will propose changes I would make to remove all negative connotations and enable MasterClass to become a product that hundreds of millions of people love.\n\nFirst off, make it free.\n\nMaking MasterClass a free product would enable it to build overall viewership as quickly as possible in terms of its number of users and hours of content watched. They say content is king but it is only king when it drives viewership. The king is powerless without enough people to serve. Give everyone access for free and anyone who would ever try it will, and there will be no reason ever to cancel.\n\nTo make this work, I believe MasterClass could support itself on an ad-based model, but I would be very thoughtful about its design. Podcasts present the best model to replicate. In podcasts, commercials are presented by the podcast host who listeners generally like and trust, and the host genuinely seems to recommend the products and services he or she promotes.\n\nMasterClass should take a similar approach where teachers promote things they genuinely use and like. There are plenty of brands that will pay top dollar for premium ads with big name talent in video format.\n\nThere are other changes I would propose like expanding the offering beyond crafts to include important subjects such as the climate crisis, mindfulness, and bitcoin. I would also make it more interactive, similar to Peloton, possibly even copying the live concept where the classes are actually recorded somewhere with students engaging and asking questions.\n\nIn summary, MasterClass has launched an awesome product, but I still don’t like it. With a few small changes, I believe I would love it, and that the world would too."}]}

I jotted down a few notes along the way, and when I got back, I wrote a book. I called it, All Across America.\n\nI dedicated the book to my family and friends, to Kerouac and Cassady for the inspiration, and “to America, the beautiful.” At the end of the dedication I wrote, “Finally, to the people of America – who have exploration in their DNA, pursuers of opportunity, change-chasers and risk-takers, critical doubters and faithful believers, leaders of the new world.”\n\nI remain confident in all aspects of my assessment of the American people, except for perhaps the last part, “leaders of the new world.” I still believe that many Americans will be crucial leaders of the new world, but I am not so sure that they will be as dominant a part of that leadership as I had once imagined. I am even less sure that they will be leading from within the confines of America at all.\n\nSee, I still believe Americans have “exploration in their DNA\". I still believe they are “pursuers of opportunity, change-chasers and risk-takers, critical doubters and faithful believers\". It is for these very reasons that I believe within the next couple of decades we may see a mass emigration from America, similar to the exodus we are currently seeing from San Francisco, but on a larger scale.\n\nIn the last few years, staunch opposers of the Trump Administration’s immigration policies have been quick to point out that America is a country of immigrants. Regardless of where one stands on immigration policies, it is clear to see that this observation is correct. It is a fact that The United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country in the world. The US has 4% of the world’s population but about 20% of the world’s immigrants. Expanding beyond the immigrants themselves, these immigrants and their US-born children comprise approximately 28% of the US population. If we expand the classification of relative newcomers to also include people whose grandparents immigrated to America, the figure seems to be roughly between 40-50%.\n\nMoreover, I would argue that even those whose ancestors came to America long before their grandparents were born may still carry a bit of extra inclination towards exploration in their blood. Since its inception, America has been viewed as “the land of opportunity.” Generations of the most ambitious risk-takers from around the globe have left everything they knew to pursue an opportunity they couldn’t find at home. They sought lives that could be better than any which many of their friends had ever imagined, and America was where they came to find it. These people helped build America into all that it has become, but it is important to recognize that they did not come here because it’s called America. They came here because of what America was, and in the eyes of some, what it still is. But it seems to me that America's monopoly as the de facto land of opportunity is one which may be losing its dominance in a world that is ever more globalized, digital, and mobile. If that is in fact the case, America's position may be up for grabs in the decades to come, a position which could be filled by an old country, or a new one, or a few ones, or many. If better options than America do become available to a meaningful number of Americans who recognize them as such, we may quickly be reminded that every individual with immigration in their history has emigration in their blood.\n\nThe question will become whether there is something unique about American Patriotism, or whether recent immigrants or their children, grandchildren, or more distant relatives will do the same thing they or their ancestors did when they came to America in the first place. I wonder how many would gather their things and go somewhere they can imagine living a better life. I wonder how many would pursue a freer life in some new land of opportunity, in some newer newest attractor of the American spirit -- for that spirit is a part of the American people, not of the American land."}]}

It is not easy, but it is certainly a whole lot easier than I thought it would be. It has also become easier week after week and my growing conviction in the practice has enabled me to stick with it without much temptation to quit or make significant alterations to the original plan. One small alteration that I have made is removing Sunday dinner from the \"on\" period that I defined as Sunday dinner through Friday lunch when I started. I found that it is much easier for me to make the first meal of the \"on\" period a smoothie on Monday after the first of five consecutive 16-hour dinner-to-noon fasts for the week which passively initiates my \"on\" period. This change gives me the freedom to eat whatever I want for dinner on Sunday and that tends to be a more enjoyable way to close the weekend than with rice and beans.\n\nIf you assume the normal 3 meals per day, which I do not necessarily abide by, my new practice works out to a 2:1 ratio in terms of \"on\" time (3 meals Monday through Thursday + 2 meals Friday = 14 meals \"on\") vs. \"off\" time (1 meal Friday + 3 meals Saturday and Sunday = 7 meals \"off\"). Of course, the \"off\" meals do not need to be comprised of totally unhealthy things, but the point is to give weekend freedom and overall balance to the practice. I choose to use that freedom for things like good pizza, pasta, bacon and eggs, burgers, and sushi, not so much for garbage like Fritos or soda.\n\nOne of the unforeseen positives of this practice for me has been how much I enjoy my weekend meals now. For foods I already loved, the new scarcity of my consumption has only made them more holy. Conversely, by the end of the weekend (but not before Sunday dinner), I have always felt ready and even excited to get back on the program on Monday.\n\nThe quantity and diversity of amazing places to eat in New York City is one of the things I love the most about it. For anyone interested in discovering new restaurants in the city, I will write briefly about a few of those places that I enjoyed this weekend below.\n\nMud Spot \\- hearty set meal brunch with a mimosa, beer or OJ and a mud drip coffee for about $25 all in. The coffee is strong and dark as the name of the spot suggests. The atmosphere feels like it belongs in a Colorado ski town with its lodge-like interior and classic rock music. It is a good vibe. I went with my brother and we sat and drank coffee well beyond the check.\n\nBua \\- dinner options priced in the low teens include burgers, fried chicken sandwiches, and more. All of them are written on a board on the wall in addition to the menus on the table. I like that. The fried chicken sandwich was delicious. The bar side of the restaurant was pretty packed with boozers. The restaurant side had a 15-20 minute wait which we gladly withstood for a table. They played a couple songs by A Tribe Called Quest as well as Outkast's SpottieOttieDopaliscious which cemented the deal for me personally. I went with Neil, Ben, and Albert who deserves credit for picking the place. The three of them were my fellow analysts in the New York office when I worked for Houlihan. We had a great time and the pressure is on for whoever picks the place we go next.\n\nLa Pizza & La Pasta at Eataly NYC Flatiron \\- solid to great pizza and pasta within the most comprehensive and authentic Italian market that I know in the city. This was not my first time in Eataly but before my first time I had always assumed it would be somewhat commercial given the name. That is definitely not the case. It is totally legit and the closest thing I have seen to Mercado Centrale, my incredible makeshift dining hall during my semester in Florence. Lunch Sunday was with Kyle who I mentioned in this post last week. His pasta came out a few minutes before my pizza and we decided once and for all that the tradition of waiting for everyone to have their food served before anyone can eat is utterly ridiculous and entirely impractical. Having sat on both sides of the stupidity countless times, I can say for certain that the person with the food generally wants to eat it and the person everyone is waiting for wants them to eat it because it is awkward and uncomfortable to sit and wait while everyone is waiting for you to get your food. If no one wants it, why do we wait. I understand of course if the food is all coming out at once and you are talking about a matter of seconds, but if it is going to be more than a minute or a few, everyone should eat."}]}

They are constant and distracting. This makes them constant distractions. I have turned them off completely for almost all of the apps on my phone.\n\nEmail can be the single worst offender of notifications, and unlike many of the others, it is of course not contained to only your phone. In my old job, I had 3 screens at my desk and one of them was entirely committed to having my email open all day every day. I did not have much of a choice. Many of my higher-ups required me to be extremely responsive, and for our clients I wanted to be. Of course, many emails do not need to be dealt with right away, but since some do, we end up treating less urgent emails with an ASAP sense of urgency. This is not good. Also, many people I know have inboxes that look like this - Inbox (25,687). I have preferred to create a system of organization that allows me to empty my inbox to zero at least once a day. I think most people would be surprised by the percentage of emails in their inbox that they can without consequence move to an archive folder without taking any action at all (still totally available and easily searchable of course). The rest can go into other folders by whatever system of organization you see fit, but email organization is not what I am writing about today.\n\nGetting back to the subject described by the title of this post, I would not subscribe to my own blog because I do not subscribe to any daily emails. If I know the blog or daily newsletter or whatever it is is going to share something daily, then the notification that something has been posted each day is not useful to me. Rather, it is a distraction and it makes me more inclined to read whatever it is at the time I receive it rather than at the time when I would prefer to read it, which is whenever I want to.\n\nOf course, I like to think I would choose to read my own blog, but instead of subscribing I would simply add blogofjake.com to my customized start page, start.me (or to bookmarks), like I do for all of the other sites I follow. I would read the post of the day (or yesterday if I am reading in the morning) whenever I want to read it, rather than having it sit in my inbox and feel that because of the form in which it has been delivered it is just another thing that needs to be dealt with.\n\nOn a side note, I recommend anyone not happy with their current browser’s start page (likely the default if you read my last post) to check out start.me . I have been using it for a couple of months now and like it a lot. You can pretty much make it whatever you want it to be. I deleted everything it came with to start, and added from there.\n\nLastly, for my blog in particular, I find the email format to be a bit cluttered and ugly. I am sure that there must be a way to modify that, at least to some degree, but frankly I have not looked into it yet. I just like the way it looks on the blog. I understand and respect the fact that many people have different preferences than I do. I tend to think more about the systems in my life and how they impact me even in the smallest ways.

A lot of people desperately want to get into it, but a lot of people who are in it desperately want out. People want in because it pays very well, you learn a lot quickly, and it opens a lot of doors. They want out because, once they are in, those doors are opened and through them often awaits a better balance of high pay, more enjoyable work, and reasonable hours. I always considered myself very fortunate to get a job in investment banking, let alone doing technology mergers and acquisitions for a great firm. I was still (and remain) very grateful for my 2+ years there between San Francisco (18 months) and New York (9 months), but a few months ago, at the end of September, I decided to quit.\n\nI quit for a variety of reasons. When I told one colleague from another office that I was quitting without my next job lined up, his assumption was quick. He said, \"You must really be pretty miserable then. Hey, I can't blame you.\" But that wasn't the case. I didn't love working well into the AMs some weekdays or being on call all the time and often having a lot of work to do on weekends, but I was not working 100 hour weeks spare maybe 2 or 3 over more than a hundred weeks in 2+ years. Sidenote: A lot of people in banking exaggerate their hours, but 70-90 real hours is still a ton and about as high as any person would want to go, trust me. 100 hours requires, for example, 10AM to 2AM Monday through Thursday (64 hours), 10AM to 10PM on Friday (12 hours), and another 24 hours however you want it (you don't) on the weekend. Like I said, I only had 2 or 3 of those weeks and they sucked. The guy who assumed I was miserable probably knew I was not getting killed that badly but he figured I was fed up with dealing with a couple of particularly tough senior bankers. That was not it either. I have a pretty high tolerance for dealing with that sort of stuff so long as I have my reasons to do so. The truth was that there was no real reason why I was miserable because, like I said, I wasn't. I felt very fortunate to have the option to continue doing what I was doing, but also, to have the option not to.\n\nA lot of people take their first job after banking more because they want to get out of banking than because want to get in on whatever they are getting in on. They are often objectively great opportunities and no one usually questions why people take them except for the people themselves who cannot help but wonder if it is just another short-term step in some direction towards an ambiguous vision of a better life where \"work\" is enjoyable and life is better. I have never believed in \"destination happiness\", the concept that if I can just get this or have that I will be happy. Don't get me wrong, I believe in the value of making sacrifices and paying your dues, but not on an infinite timeline. After a couple years of abnormally hard work, I looked at my situation from a neutral point of view, crucially ignoring the illusion of the default which told me that I should stay at my job unless I had a clear and obvious reason to quit (like a next job lined up). I knew by this point that I did not want to rise through the ranks in typical investment banking fashion, so rather than stay until I found something else to do, I decided to quit and do anything else I wanted to do.\n\nI appreciate the fact that I was very fortunate to have the freedom to make this choice. In 2+ years I had worked more hours than many of my peers would work in 3 or 4 years at their jobs, and as such I had earned income at a pretty disproportionate rate as well. I had saved enough money (outside of a relatively illiquid real estate investment) to comfortably buy myself at least several months of living without working in New York (or several years in Thailand, India or Vietnam, not that I wanted to do that). I had recently received my second year bonus and so with virtually no additional bonus money accrued (earned but unpaid), I could quit without feeling like I was leaving any earned money on the table (I would argue the bonus structure for junior bankers would be gone if not for its usefulness as a mechanism to trap solid bankers into rising through the ranks). Two of my three major deals had just closed and the third had just passed a critical checkpoint so I could effectively leave without screwing my deal teams. My lease was up at the end of the month so I was not tied to any large recurring payments (rent) and I would be free to travel wherever I wanted and I could even do so for a lower cost of living than my rent alone. A lot of people say that with a lot of things the timing will never be right and so you just have to do it. Fortunately for me, in the case of quitting my job, the timing was just right, so I quit.\n\nI spent my first week without a job at home with my family in New Jersey. The next week Lauren and I had a week-long vacation in Praiano, Italy (an awesome little town between Amalfi and Positano on the Amalfi Coast). When we booked our flights a couple of weeks prior, I chose to buy a one-way ticket. I decided on my next destination our last night in Italy and spent the next week in Paris. That was followed by a few days in Copenhagen before flying to Tokyo for a few weeks traveling through Japan with my buddy Eric who was a couple of months into a year-long trip of traveling the world. I had some luck while I was traveling in that my investment in Tesla was literally paying for my travels as I went (part of why I sold too soon). Eric is currently a few continents in on his goal of running a marathon on all of them and so after training on his schedule for a bit I was in the best shape of my life running 30 mile weeks soon after Japan. I was home by Thanksgiving and started this blog on the 1st of December. I took the time to discover my interests and define my purpose. I started learning about big things like climate change and crypto. I applied for three amazing opportunities in VC, all of which I came across organically while following my interests, and one of which I have an interview for next week. I read some books, a couple of which I did not want to put down, and with my total freedom of time, I did not have to (recommend World After Capital by Albert Wenger and The Fixer by Bradley Tusk). As you already know if you have been reading the blog, I spent 10 days in Israel, celebrated New Years Eve in Tel Aviv, and now I am back home with a few more exciting things up my sleeve. This week (Sunday dinner through Friday lunch) I am going to try to eat vegan and gluten-free... we'll see.\n\nThis blog is and will always be for me if no one else. It forces me to write every weekday and to have something interesting to write about and to do that I have to live a somewhat interesting life and learn about interesting things. I like that this blog serves as a public record and I sincerely hope that over time, more and more people read what I write and find it to be valuable or enjoyable to read, if not both, but at the very least, it is for me. This post is no different. My motivation to write it was to think about my response to the inevitable questions I will get about why I quit my job and how I have spent my time since. There are better and worse ways for me to craft an honest answer but the truth is so simple that it does not require any crafting at all. There were all of the reasons I mentioned and more for why it made sense for me to quit, and there were all of the things that I mentioned I have done since and more that have made me glad that I did, but when I throw my pros and cons paper in the garbage and let go of my need to justify my decision to quit, the answer is simple and clear. It all just feels right."}]}

It combines stretching, meditation, and yoga. I call it Smoga.\n\nAll three of the practices incorporated are ones that I believe are good for me but I have had trouble committing to any of them, let alone all of them, in the past. My early success with smoga, however, gives me reason to believe that the practice may stick. It works well because even though I want to stretch and meditate and do yoga, I never really want to do any of them. To clarify, I believe there is a difference between the things we say and think we want to do versus the things that we actually want to do at any given moment. These three practices are excellent examples to highlight that difference for me personally as I want to do all of them but never really want to do any of them.\n\nBecause it combines all of the three practices, Smoga feels much more worthwhile than any of the them do individually. On their own merits, the three practices sometimes feel like they have not done a whole lot for me, but with smoga, even if I do not feel much better as a result, I have a very high degree of confidence that what I just did was good and worthwhile. That may in part be due to the fact that I made it up and that I have a natural bias towards believing in any of the things that organically come to believe in, but whatever the reason, it is working for me.\n\nIf you were to look for any existing information on smoga, you might google it like I did. In doing so, you would find that the results are diverse and unexpectedly entertaining, and I will summarize the top three of them below to save you the trouble.\n\nThe first is a 2011 made YouTube video of four eastern European women satirically smoking cigarettes while doing yoga. The two-minute video shows \"expert yoga teacher and smoker\" Veronica Butskitighten teaching the principles and methodologies of what she also calls smoga. It is absolutely absurd but at the same time better than any SNL skit I have seen in a while, so I watched it twice, but I am going to stick with my version of smoga for now.\n\nThe second is a link to a page from the Mayo Clinic with something about the screening and diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies including analysis of free light chains. I have no idea what that means but I am confident it has nothing to do with stretching, meditation, or yoga.\n\nFinally, the third result shows smoga as it is defined by urban dictionary which is \"to do yoga while smoking marijuana\". This definition falls closer to the practice that Veronica teaches, and though it sounds significantly more enjoyable, it not my smoga.\n\nMy smoga is simple. Get on the ground, put a timer on for 10 minutes or however long you want to do it for, close your eyes, and transition between various stretches and yoga positions while at the same time focusing on your breath and simply witnessing your thoughts as they pass through rather than letting them pull your attention in any infinite number of directions. It is that easy.\n\nWhile it is still early days in terms of my experience with the practice, smoga has been great for me so far. If you think stretching, meditation, and/or yoga could be good for you too, give smoga a try. Just leave the cigarettes out of it."}]}

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. \"\n> \n> Steve Jobs\n\nThis is one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite speeches. Steve talks about the importance of trusting in something. The thing that I have come to trust over the years is that everything happens for a reason. I don't know if it is true, but I have faith that some version of it is worth believing. Steve describes some of the other versions as gut, destiny, life, and karma. His last option, \"whatever\", implies that it doesn't actually matter very much what you trust in, so long as you \"trust in something\".\n\nFor much of human history, religion was that \"something\" for the vast majority of people on earth. One could argue that that is still the case today. Technically, they would be right, but I can feel the role of religion in many households shrinking from a true practice of faith to a calendar of holidays bringing days off work and perhaps a few nice family traditions. There may even be a real remembrance of faith on the holiday itself, but it tends to be fleeting, an exception rather than the norm, and that's alright. I don't believe everyone needs religion. I just believe everyone could use some faith.\n\nGrowing up, I was extremely skeptical of everything. I didn't have faith in anything in particular. I pushed back on anything anyone told me they believed, especially if they tried to convince me to do the same. I think you can get away with this perspective as a kid. Perhaps it takes some child-like courage to live without the comfort of faith to fall back on. I remember thinking when I was very young, if I ever ended up becoming religious, it would be because I was not strong enough to deal with real doubt. I told myself never to forget this, and obviously I didn't, but at some point I chose to ignore it, sort of. I still don't believe every word of any religion by any means, but I do think there are aspects from most all of them that could be worth believing. More importantly, I have come to believe it is worth believing in something.\n\nSome people think that faith and doubt are opposites. As my younger self often said, I disagree. In fact, I do not believe one can have faith without doubt, for it is the uncertainty of the doubt itself which requires the faith. I once wrote, \"A true man of faith does not avoid the creep of doubt. Rather, he lives with it long enough to choose to believe a few things.\"\n\nYou have to know that you don't know much, but choose to have faith in something, or to \"trust in something\", as Steve said. His famous example about not being able to connect the dots looking forward was the story of how sitting in on a calligraphy class in college led to the introduction of beautiful font options on the Mac.\n\nI recently recalled an example of my own. In high school, I used to freestyle and record rap songs with a few of my best friends. I would never have thought that would have been helpful towards anything except the music we were making at the time, but I realize now that had I never learned to record and edit audio or become comfortable hearing my own voice, I may never have started my podcast. In a way, anything that the podcast leads me to now will be thanks not only to the podcast, but also to my high school days of rapping. Back when we were recording, I had never even heard of a podcast, let alone imagined I would one day have one of my own.\n\nPerhaps there are some dots to be connected looking back on your life which you can appreciate could never have been connected looking forward. \"So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something.\""}]}

Here’s the backstory:\n\nAs everyone knows, in 2020, the world went remote. People quickly realized they no longer had to live in the city where their office was located. So they left cities like New York and San Francisco for places with lower costs of living, better quality of life, or simply some more space — places like Miami, Austin, Denver, and smaller towns around the country and around the world.\n\nThis newfound ability to live somewhere nowhere near your office was obvious. But most people have yet to fully appreciate the second great freedom granted by the sudden shift to remote work. It’s not just that you no longer have to live in the one place where your office is located. You no longer have to live in one place at all.** You can live in multiple places throughout the year. You can spend several months here and a couple months there. You can live more seasonally than most humans have since we first became farmers. The only problem is that our current systems are not built to facilitate this sort of seasonal living. \n\nIf you have a mortgage or a 12-month lease and you want to go live somewhere else for a couple months, sure, you can find a long-term Airbnb, but it’s priced at a premium. More importantly, you have to continue to pay your rent or your mortgage while you’re away. This is what we call double rent. We do not like double rent.\n\nDouble rent prevents people from living the way they want to live. It stops people from being able to live wherever they want, whenever they want, because they have to pay for their place even when they’re not using it. It kills optionality and adds friction between the way you're living and the way you want to live. No more! \n\nOur objective with The Subletter is to defeat the dreaded double rent. Our goal is to create a marketplace where people can post their place with confidence that someone trustworthy will step up to stay in and pay for their place while they’re away. In short, our goal is to increase the liquidity for sublets.\n\nMost generally, we want to help free people to live exactly the way they want to live. It’s a big mission, and we believe this marketplace for sublets is a big step. We hope you’ll join us in these early days by going and finding a place or listing your own at thesubletter.com.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading. We appreciate your support."}]}

Whether radically means 20%, 50%, 2x, or more than 5x longer, I cannot say, but I believe by attacking the process of aging directly, scientists and technologists may find effective ways to extend the human healthspan. By doing so, we would buy ourselves additional time to make additional breakthroughs in slowing, stopping, and/or reversing aging so that eventually we may reach longevity escape velocity. This term, coined by Aubrey de Grey, represents a hypothetical situation in which we would be extending life expectancy faster than we would be aging. The almost unimaginable implication of achieving such a state is that humans could potentially dodge death in perpetuity, hypothetically living not necessarily forever, but perhaps for as long as we wanted.\n\nI will not put a probability on this scenario, and my hopes for my own healthspan are certainly more conservative, for the time being at least, but there is an idea that often comes up in opposition to the possibility of extending human healthspan which is important to address. Aubrey defines the sort of trapped thinking which I would like to help some people escape as the pro-aging trance. Listen to the 90-second explanation from 4:35 - 6:05 (47:42 - 46:12 remaining) which Aubrey gave in the podcast episode I recorded with him earlier this year.\n\n[URL]\n\nAs Aubrey explains, for all of human history, it has made sense to rationalize death and aging as best we could because the possibility of living 50% or 2x or 5x longer or indefinitely seemed impossible. If solving aging and defeating death is hopeless, which it was, it of course makes sense to justify why it would be bad and undesirable even if the reasons we use to justify that don’t make sense (over-population, food shortage, death giving meaning to life, etc.).\n\nIt is important today to recognize that what seemed impossible in the past may, in fact, only be difficult. I don't write that to trivialize the difficulty of an achievement so ambitious as reversing aging, but rather to clearly differentiate that which is difficult from that which is impossible. This is an extremely important distinction to make because impossible achievements are not worth pursuing whereas difficult pursuits may be the most worthwhile of all, especially if the reward is something so significant as to successfully help humans live meaningfully longer and healthier lives.\n\nFor those who may be wondering what has changed to make what once seemed impossible suddenly (in the context of human history) within striking distance, it is important to appreciate not only the potential of new and exciting technologies like CRISPR and stem cell therapies, but also the recent achievements along the relevant metrics which have already been accomplished. The first two milestones which I mentioned above (living 50% or 2x longer) have already been reached in the last ~100 years as per this incredibly hopeful chart below:\n\nPeople argue against the continuation of this chart by contending that it was mostly due to decreasing child mortality and infectious diseases and that we would need new angles to extend the trend much further. This observation is reasonably fair but to argue that those new angles are not possible just because they have not yet been achieved is not. If you looked at this same chart going back centuries or even millennia it would look flat forever with just a small vertical blip at the end. Just because child mortality and infectious diseases were the first big ticket items which we tackled does not mean that there are no others for us to solve. I believe humanity will one day reflect on the last century or so of increasing human healthspan as phase 1 of the process and that targeting aging directly and materially increasing not just the average but the maximum human healthspan will be phase 2.\n\nFor the same sensible reasons that the pro-aging trance exists in the first place, it is a somewhat dangerous game even now to start believing you can live healthfully well past 100 before the technology to do so is evidently here. Without further technological advancements, the chances would remain that you will be wrong, and the thought of having hope for something which may never come to fruition is always scary. Still, people buy lottery tickets everyday and dare to dream of what they would buy with their winnings even though such an outcome has far lesser odds in their favor. The risk of hope in any instance is that you may well be disappointed in the end, but the reward is that the thing you hope for becomes reality, and in most cases that never could have happened had you never dared to dream when it seemed unlikely.\n\nIn humanity's quest to live longer and healthier lives, we need some people to start believing it is possible or even probable before it necessarily makes perfect sense to do so. The growing group of early believers brings attention to the efforts which in turn brings funding which accelerates progress so that we may achieve milestones like the doubling of healthspans in mice. The achievement of every milestone bring incrementally more believers and eventually defeating death may become the probable destiny that the people in the beginning believed even before it was true. This is similar to the way those who believed Bitcoin would become what it has over the last decade were irrational when they held that belief in the beginning but are now recognized as having been right.\n\nI am not asking you to believe people will be able to live healthy lives for as long as they desire. All I am suggesting is that you open your mind to the potential that living longer and healthier lives may be possible within our lifetimes, and more importantly, that such a thing would be inherently good. Commonly cited problems like over-population and food shortages are far from unsolvable. In fact, many have argued in the past that we could not sustain the populations we have now, but here we are. These arguments and others which oppose efforts to extend the human healthspan have been conveniently used to excuse us historically from having false hope for something that seemed impossible, but it is now time for us to realize the irrational nature of these excuses and the rational reasons for believing we can live longer and healthier lives. If one would not desire to live youthfully well beyond 100 and experience a shorter period of suffering at the end of a longer life, the problem is less likely to be with the new way of dying than with one's current way of living.\n\nI believe this is the best time to be alive in the history of humanity. I believe the future will be even better. I believe we can live longer, healthier, and happier lives. Do you dare to join to me?"}]}

Often, I have had more than one. None of them have been particularly bad in the scheme of things, but some of them, like the amount I drank in college, are more obviously damaging if continued over the long haul than others, like the amount of video games I played when I was younger. I used to think that I needed at least one vice of some sort no matter what, but when my friend texted me earlier this week and asked if I had any vices at home, I realized that I did not.\n\nTo understand what that means for me in particular, it is useful to remember that I count relatively innocent activities like excessive coffee drinking and iPhone usage to be vices too.

With a plan to meet a buddy in Pittsburgh for lunch and then a few more in Chicago, a couple of whom would join me for the rest of the trip, the first leg to Pittsburgh was a solo drive. On the way, I needed to make only one stop for gas and a bathroom break in Hershey, PA, which is in fact the home of its namesake chocolate company, Hershey's. After the trip, I wrote a book about the journey. Below is an excerpt about my time in the bathroom in Hershey.\n\nI saw a few words scratched into the paint of the bathroom door. All of the words were crossed out except for the most recent one that was on top of all of the others, “BLOOD”. Some combination of the spontaneity of the trip upon which I was embarking and my general state of mind at the time motivated me take a quarter out of my wallet and put a cross through “BLOOD” just as someone had done to all of the words prior. Above it, I etched out a word of my own, “PEACE”. This action felt right, even though at face value, etching a word into the paint of a bathroom door of a gas station would be considered wrong. This is a good example of precisely the problem that I have with the way the world works as long as I have seen it which is that people tend to believe passionately that certain uncertain things are right or wrong or good or bad while ignoring the fact that context or specificities of such things can quite easily make it so that anything can be right AND wrong or good AND bad depending on the situation. Even this ignores my belief that there is really no good or bad or right or wrong in this world but that the only thing that there is is that there is and that what happens happens and it is what it is. The better way for me to describe this concept is to explain my belief that serves as the foundation for my belief that there is no definitive good or bad, which is that good and bad are only words representing polar opposites such as yin and yang. Words, I believe, hold no meaning, but rather serve as a guide of differentiation that can serve to communicate an ambiguous message from human to human that can never quite be perfectly communicated because there is no “thing” to communicate.

James' podcast Below The Line aims to uncover the true stories of founders' journeys before they were successful, including honest recollections of all of the ups and downs along the way. Most successful people tend to only share the surface level highlights of their stories, and as such, that is all that most people get to hear. James' podcast is refreshingly real and I recommend it strongly to anyone who is interested in learning about the true journeys of entrepeneurs.\n\nIn the episode that I mentioned, Mike offered a useful framework for decision-making that I had never heard before. He said that most decisions are either 70/30 or 51/49 in terms of right/wrong.\n\nIf we feel we are dealing with a 70/30 decision, then we feel we know which decision is the right one. Unfortunately, we often hesitate to make the right decision even when we know it is the right decision. Worse than that, we often make the wrong decision even when we know it is the wrong one. This is an important point to recognize. We can all work as hard as we want to improve our decision-making abilities, but if we do not make the right decisions when we are confident they are right, it is all for naught. With 70/30 decisions, Mike says that people should just make the right decision and make it quickly. Time is a valuable resource and any time spent dwelling further on a 70/30 decision is a waste of time and a disservice to self.\n\n51/49 decisions comprise most of the rest of them. These are the decisions in which we do not feel confident either way. The trick here is to feel equally confident both ways. If it is a 51/49 decision, it will be very hard to argue that either way is right or wrong. Same as with 70/30 decisions, we should move forward quickly without dwelling on 51/49 decisions, not because we know the right decision, but precisely because we do not know it. I have written about the ambiguity between right and wrong and good and bad here and here in the past and it is a core principle that I rely on a lot.\n\nThe 70/30 vs. 51/49 framework for decision-making is intended to help us make more good decisions faster. Combined with a sound approach to analyzing those decisions in the first place, this should lead to a better path as directed by these good decisions.\n\nMaybe you can make a 70/30 decision right now."}]}

The Democratic National Convention begins on August 17th and only two candidates in modern history have waited until then to announce their running mate.\n\nBiden’s VP selection has been the largest (and essentially the only) story receiving constant attention related to his campaign for President over the last few months. It has been followed closely only by the narrative that he has lost his marbles which has flared up once again following his regrettable comments about African Americans the other day. One could even speculate that the first storyline has been dragged out by Biden’s campaign intentionally in order to prevent the second from receiving more attention than it already is.\n\nThese top two storylines are fundamentally about indecision and a lack of fitness to serve as President, respectively. These are not good themes for someone aiming to get elected President, a role which requires one to be decisive and fit to serve as two of the most primary prerequisites.\n\nI remain baffled by the way Biden’s original VP guarantee has been almost unanimously applauded and totally uncontroversial in the media. If Biden knew his pick already and she was a woman, I would have had no problem with him saying so a few months ago without prematurely revealing her identity at that stage. That was clearly not the case.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Biden had no idea who he was going to pick when he made that guarantee to help secure the primary. This has been demonstrated by months of indecision on the matter with several names moving up and down the leaderboard of his most likely picks. This, to me, makes his guarantee an unfortunate one, though I try to give him the benefit of the doubt that his intentions were good at best and simply to get votes at worst.\n\nThat said, if I was a woman, I cannot imagine that I would want the first female Vice President to be selected this way, with the fact that she is a woman being the first and most outwardly advertised criteria. Furthermore, it now seems that our potential next VP’s race has become the second most necessary qualification, although Biden has not as explicitly said so.\n\nI believe that the first female Vice President deserves to be selected at least apparently because she is the best person for the job, not just because she is the best woman for the job or the best black woman for the job. She should be chosen as the best candidate from a field that includes the best of the best regardless of gender or race. Anything else suggests that no woman is capable of landing the position by merit and that is so obviously not true.\n\nHave people already forgotten that Hillary won the popular vote last election? We were well on our way to having our first female President well before this ugly and unnecessary VP guarantee.\n\nBarack Obama won back to back elections to become the first black President. Can you imagine how much less meaningful that would have been if he was instead elected after we decided as a country that we were only going to pick from a pool of black candidates that year? Americans decided he was the best person for the job. That’s how it should be.\n\nBiden’s VP selection comes with added consequence considering he would become the oldest President in America’s history on his first day in The Oval Office. Assuming he makes it through his first term, which is all but guaranteed, it seems doubtful that he would run for a second one. That would leave his VP as the candidate closest to being an incumbent and, all else equal, the most likely to win.\n\nTo be clear, I look forward to the day we have our first female President. I just hope she rises to power via election by the people of America, not via selection by the consultants of a presidential candidate who are only looking to assure the greatest possible benefit to his polls."}]}

The show is really about nothing, so it sort of ends up being about everything. The episodes are short, usually between 15 and 20 minutes a piece. The format is conversational and more similar to a podcast than a traditional TV show or anything else I can think of. It seems like there is very little effort put into the whole thing, and maybe that is partly intentional, but I do think a lot of it probably came together somewhat by chance. It feels like a show that Jerry genuinely wanted to do, more than it does a formula that he pieced together because he thought it would resonate well enough with a few key demographics to make good money. He has plenty of that already. Regardless, Jerry's short-form, star-studded, open-ended, subjectlessly conversational show just works, and I like watching it. The cool and old-school cars and New York / Los Angeles coffee shops also do not hurt as the setting.\n\nOne of the episodes that I watched last night was the one with Bill Burr. Bill is one of the more politically incorrect comedians I have heard. He is also one of the funnier comedians in my opinion, and more objectively one of the most successful ones on the circuit today. In the episode, Jerry and Bill talked about the way that comedians are increasingly dealing with scandals and controversies regarding their jokes. Bill asks how the audience members who spark these controversies with their backlash can possibly assert the comedian's intention when he or she says and knows he or she was joking. That is what comedians do. They joke. No joke will be funny to everyone but most jokes will be funny to someone. The comedians whose jokes are funnier to more people theoretically become more popular and eventually famous. I do not think that it is fair to then \"cancel\" these people who have become popular by our own demand because of one joke that some person or group of people does not like or finds offensive. That person or group of people can certainly tune them out. There is tons of messed up humor on Instagram for example that millions of people choose to follow and like that I choose not to. This sort of stuff usually goes much further than a comedian would go on stage because of the anonymity afforded by the online presence. If there is a limit on the range of things that some people in the world make jokes about these days, I have yet to discover it. That is why I believe that the high standards of political correctness imposed by the media (incentivized by our clicks) is as due for a correction as the S&P 500 (i.e. it seems due for a reversal of the ongoing trend).\n\nIn short, society as represented by the media thinks it is degrees of magnitude more proper and \"correct\" than the actual people comprising it really are these days (while we are still in seriousness probably more proper than ever), and so it holds people to this ridiculous standard where certain jokes and even mistakes (which everyone makes) are no longer tolerated, and opinions that high society has agreed among themselves are wrong are now intolerable and shameful, embarrassingly ignorant. While the level of civility in social conversation (especially online & mobile) continues to find new lows, the media-enforced societal expectations for political correctness have never been higher. I have been saying this for a few years now already. Something has to give."}]}

Gunshots and loud blasts could be heard with varying degrees of volume in the not so far sounding distance. Fortunately, it was only the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) combat training.\n\nLater, we spent an hour taking in the vista from the top of a no longer functioning IDF bunker. Between us and the Syrian border was about a football field of land. On the majority of the field, from about the 20 to the 20 yard line using that same football reference, a few dozen cows grazed. The red zones had yellow flags to show that those areas were filled with land mines.\n\nOn the way home, we drove along the Jordanian border and after dinner we had a journalist come in and talk with us about geopolitics in the Middle East. Israel’s border issues are seemingly endless in their complexities but today’s lecture helped to give me an extremely rudimentary understanding of what is going on at the north border with Hezbollah and its military stronghold in Lebanon, to the northeast with the civil war drawing global attention in Syria, and with the Gaza Strip in the lower left corner of Israel where the Hamas so regularly shoot rockets and drops fires via kites over Israel’s border that it is referred to as a cyclical occurrence. There is also the Israeli-Palestinian conflict taking root on the West Bank (of Jordan) in eastern Israel. I will not go deeper into any of these subjects because my understanding of them is far less than my available time to write today, which is also very little.\n\nStill, I look forward to learning more and discussing with people who know a lot more about these subjects than I do."}]}

It is an unfortunate but understandable phenomenon. Unfortunate because it traps people with enormous potential in relatively inconsequential industries like investment banking, management consulting, and law. But understandable because these paths make people predictably rich and perceived as “successful”.\n\nIt usually starts in high school. The highest achieving students compete to get into the most prestigious colleges — Harvard, Stanford, etc.. Then they compete to get into the most prestigious companies in the most prestigious industries — Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company, etc.. Then they compete for the fastest promotions, for the most prestigious exits, for more money and “better” jobs.\n\nThe problem is that these people, despite their consensus brilliance, often fail to think honestly about why they are doing what they are doing while they are doing it. They optimize their careers for what looks the best and what makes the most (money). Then they realize when they’re 40 or 50 that they succeeded by everyone else’s standards other than their own. Deep down, they know they could have done something more interesting, more fulfilling, more different, but they didn’t.\n\nI was one of these people, and I could easily have ended up that way. I graduated from a Top 20 university and dutifully began my career in investment banking. I don’t regret either, either. But I am sure glad that I thought independently enough to start doing things a bit differently before I got stuck. Even before I graduated or got into banking, I started straddling the line between the prestigious path and a less predictable one. I dropped out of college after my freshman year and tried to start a successful business. The company failed, so I went back to school and then on to investment banking, but I got a taste of what it was like to do things differently than the other ambitious people around me.\n\nSo, after a couple of years in investment banking, I decided to quit. I didn’t know what I was going to do next, but I knew that quitting without knowing what was next was to do something different in and of itself, and I knew I wanted to do something different again. I ended up starting a blog, then a podcast, and then working full-time with Balaji Srinivasan, an extraordinarily unique individual himself, who I am proud to have served as Chief of Staff. Now, I know this is starting to sound impressive again, perhaps even prestigious, but it’s starting to sound a bit different too, and that makes all the difference.\n\nI left my position with Balaji last year and took some time to think about things. I cleared my calendar, followed my interests, and trusted the process — I had done this before. That led me to working on a short-term project with Peter Diamandis after having him as a guest on my podcast, the same way I got started working with Balaji. Peter is another extraordinarily unique individual. Like Balaji, he believes in a future that is radically different from the present. I believe in that too. So maybe I’m a futurist, or a “tech guy”. From finance to tech — not so unusual. Even when I was in banking, I was in the Technology M&A group. That wasn’t just a coincidence — I sought it out. So this is starting to make more sense.\n\nBut just when you thought you had me pegged, I went and did something that had nothing to do with technology or the future. This winter, I was the head coach of a high school JV basketball team. I’ll also mention I made a rap album several years ago. I acted in a couple amateur short films. I wrote a book I haven’t published. I sometimes wonder whether I’ve done all these things for the same reasons those ambitious high school kids I mentioned earlier seek to stack as many extracurriculars as they can so they can look as impressive as possible on their college applications, but I am confident that is not the case. \n\nHere’s the difference: \n\nMany of those kids do those things primarily because they are impressive. I do these things primarily because I am interested, and if they happen to look impressive, that’s great. In fact, I believe many people would be likely to do things that look impressive if they stopped trying so hard to do things that look impressive. It’s the natural result of doing things that you’re truly interested in, of caring and trying to do your best at things you think you might be best at doing.\n\nYou see, the point is not to not look impressive. That would just be being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. Rather, the point is to not follow the most popular and prestigious path just because it is popular and prestigious. The point is to think for yourself, to follow your interests, to do your best to find what you are best at doing and to do it to the best of your abilities. You want to be impressively different, impressively unique, impressively you.\n\nAll else equal, it is quite helpful to look impressive. It enables you to talk to people you otherwise might not be able to talk to. It opens up opportunities that otherwise might not be available to you. But it is NOT important enough that you should sacrifice following your interests for the sake of looking impressive. \n\nImpressiveness is incredibly useful as a secondary benefit, but utterly detrimental as a primary pursuit. The challenge is trusting that you will get where you want to go, or rather, that you will be grateful for the going when it is all said and done, even though you can’t know where you’ll go.\n\nThe popular paths pursuing prestige are predictable. There’s a comfort in that. You can be 22 with great confidence that when you’re 42 you will have plenty of money to support your family. You’ll be viewed as successful and no one will question anything you ever did. You’ll have done everything right. \n\nIt just might feel wrong."}]}

They have been said by many people many times before. It was one person saying them one time that made them stick with me. That person was Kobe Bryant.\n\nI wrote about Kobe the day after his death earlier this year. In doing so, I shared four of his direct quotes. One of them has come to mind, word for word, over and over again ever since I shared it.\n\n\"Do not negotiate with yourself.\"\n\nThis seemingly ordinary piece of advice has had an extraordinary effect for me. After becoming aware of Kobe's words of wisdom, I became more aware of the moments in which I was negotiating with myself. I stopped negotiating with myself in those moments. Recently, I realized my brain has been trained to stop negotiating with myself in certain situations altogether. It is so much better this way.\n\nFor example, I knew I was due to run 17 miles last Sunday. I did not feel like running at all when I woke up. I was slightly dreading it the night before. Even once I got started, the first couple miles were tougher than typical. They were slower than standard. The old me would have battled myself for the rest of the run.\n\n\"Don't you think 13 is good enough for today? That's still a great run. Legs don't feel good today. What if you just push the schedule back a week? You can do 6 today and 17 next Sunday. What's wrong with that? Well, you said you were going to do 17 today. But you don't want to push too hard if you don't feel great. You're going to hurt yourself. Forget that. Don't be a *. 6 could work though. 13 would still be really hard. Just do 13. 13 is fine. But you did say 17...\"\n\nThe mental battle would persist throughout the run. It would make the run harder and unpleasant. It would occupy my mind from being able to focus on the podcast I was listening to, or my other thoughts, or the nature around me, or nothing at all. At every mile mark, I would think about whether I had gone far enough to stop. All it takes is a split second to quit. Then you're done.\n\nDo not negotiate with yourself. Just do what you set out to do. Do not entertain any other options.\n\nI had some minor urges to negotiate Sunday's run with myself on Saturday night. I noticed at one point saying to someone, \"I am supposed to run 17 miles tomorrow\". The phrase \"supposed to\" was a clue which showed that I was considering negotiating with myself. If I was not, I would have simply said \"I am going to run 17 miles tomorrow\" instead. Still, I did not let the negotiation take place. I did not entertain the notion of doing anything other than what I had planned to do. Once I got started, the concept of not doing what I set out to do was gone entirely.\n\nCould a real injury along the way have changed that? Probably. When Kobe tore his achilles, did he finish the game? No. But he shot the free throws before leaving the court. Some may think that shows a strong body. That shows a strong mind. Unless you physically collapse, it is not your body that is deciding to stop. It is your mind. Do what you set out to do. Do not negotiate with yourself.\n\nI will close this post with a second quote from Kobe. It is the same quote that I used to close the original post that I wrote about him.\n\n“Have a good time. Enjoy life. Life is too short to get bogged down and be discouraged. You have to keep moving. You have to keep going. Put one foot in front of the other, smile, and just keep on rolling.\""}]}

The below linked speech by Andreas Antonopoulos was what flipped the switch for me, from not getting it to getting it. It is the best introduction to Bitcoin that I have heard, by far, and you do not need any prior knowledge in technology, finance, or otherwise to gain understanding from it.\n\nAndreas’ speech ends at the 25 minute mark with a Q&A session thereafter. I recommend you find a time when you have at least 25 minutes if not the full 37 to watch or listen.\n\nI have included at the end of this post my brief notes exactly as I wrote them while watching the speech. It was not the first time that I had watched it. Since my notes are copied verbatim, they will not be very useful to you as a substitution for watching the video. They may be helpful for the purpose of recollection and as an imperfect summarization that you can refer back to after watching.\n\nHere is the YouTube link to Andreas’ speech: “Introduction to Bitcoin”\n\nIf at any point after watching the video or otherwise you become interested in buying Bitcoin but do not know how, I have used Coinbase to buy mine.

It is my referral link and gives you and I both a $10 bonus in Bitcoin when you buy $100 or more on Coinbase. Another popular alternative to buy Bitcoin that I would trust is the Cash App, but I have not yet used it to do so myself.\n\nI do not recommend beginning with an amount invested more than you are comfortable losing. I also do not recommend increasing your amount invested without increasing your understanding of the assets you are investing in and reasonably gaining conviction in the future value of those assets. I will note in writing that I do not believe Bitcoin’s value is currently the lowest it will ever be. Thus, do not blame me if your investment becomes worth less than the amount you invest. I am telling you quite bluntly that if you were to invest at the time I am writing this, I believe it would. That said, I am holding my investment in Bitcoin primarily because I believe it is many times closer to the lowest it will be in the next decade or two than it is to the highest it will be in that time, in terms of its percent change in value.

I have only ever vaguely understood their definitions. \"Stories with greater meanings\" is how I thought of them, and that is not far off.\n\nHere are their definitions according to Merriam-Webster:\n\n   parable \\-- a usually short fictitious story that illustrates a moral attitude or a religious principle\n\n   allegory \\-- the expression by means of symbolic fictional figures and actions of truths or generalizations about human existence; an instance (as in a story or painting) of such expression; a symbolic representation\n\n\n\n\nMy main takeaway from these definitions are that a parable is much more simply defined. Second to that, I suppose I take away that the two words can be differentiated by the realms that they signify. Parables seem to focus on morals and religion while allegories focus more broadly on truths and generalizations about human existence. In that way, it may be that all parables are allegories, but not all allegories are parables, like rectangles and squares.\n\nThe difference between parables and allegories came to my mind after discussing Plato's Allegory of the Cave with my friend Harry this weekend and proceeding last night to stumble upon a parable about a beggar in the opening chapter of Eckhart Tolle's book, The Power of Now , which I have just begun. That last sentence makes the things that I do sound a lot more good, smart, and wholesome than they actually are, but nonetheless, it is fully true.\n\nPlato's Allegory of the Cave came up as Harry and I discussed the future of work in terms of things like millennial impatience (ourselves included) and whether the traditional 9 to 5 would survive. This reminded me of a perspective I really agreed with which I originally read in an interview with Scott Birnbaum, Founder of Red Sea Ventures. Here is what he said about millennials and the emerging generation of workers:\n\n\"They’re optimizing for a life experience that aligns with their values and allows them to live the kind of life that they want to live. I think of it as Plato’s “The Allegory of the Cave.” It tells the story of people who are born in a cave, chained against a wall, and they see a game of shadows projected against the wall, and they think those shadows are people, their only reality. And then one day they’re unshackled and as they go out of the cave towards the light they realize everything they thought was reality was a lie. We’re in that moment in history. Where this emerging generation of workers are realizing that the game of shadows they saw their parents play into is not really the life they want to live and that there is something else out there. And that light at the end of the tunnel and that unshackling is the internet, which gave them access to information and a view into how other people are living their lives.\"\n\nThe parable that I read last night in The Power of Now went as follows:\n\n\"A beggar had been sitting by the side of the road for over thirty years. One day a stranger walked by. \"Spare some change?\" mumbled the beggar, mechanically holding out his old baseball cap. \"I have nothing to give you,\" said the stranger. Then he asked: \"What's that you are sitting on?\" \"Nothing,\" replied the beggar. \"Just an old box. I have been sitting on it for as long as I can remember.\" \"Ever looked inside?\" asked the stranger. \"No,\" said the beggar. \"What's the point? There's nothing in there.\" \"Have a look inside,\" insisted the stranger. The beggar managed to pry open the lid. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was filled with gold. \"\n\nThe author follows to say:\n\n\"I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer: inside yourself. \"\n\nI am not far enough into this book yet to make any sort of assessment but was intrigued by the introduction about how the author came to be \"enlightened\" as he claims he has been. He talks about how he was dealing with suicidal depression and how on one particularly bad morning as he felt a \"deep longing for annihilation, non-existence\", he kept thinking \"I cannot live with myself any longer\", before realizing how peculiar of a thought that was. He wondered for the first time if there was one or two of him, concluding based on his thought that he could not live with himself any longer that there must be two, the one who cannot live with himself, and \"himself\" that the \"one\" cannot live with. I believe the concept this refers to is important, that of separating awareness from thoughts of the mind, and this seems a solid introduction to that, regardless of what I end up thinking about this book.\n\nParables and allegories are very literally meaningful things. I am glad to have a better understanding of what they are today than I did yesterday. Hopefully, the same is now true for you too."}]}

The company's mission is \"to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity\".\n\nIn the last few days, people have been playing around publicly with OpenAI's newest available advancement, a text-generating language model that at its best can be difficult to distinguish as non-human.\n\nSince I do not have access to the beta version where people are playing around with the technology, the closest I have been able to interact with it was through McKay Wrigley's now temporarily defunct website, learnfromanyone.com. I am not sure how exactly he built it or in what ways it may or may not be differentiated from the GPT-3 beta on its own. They seem largely the same and it is clear that the GPT-3 AI is the thing doing most of the work. One key difference is that while people apparently engage directly with the AI via the beta, on McKay's website they instead write in a \"teacher\" to engage with and a question or statement to begin the back and forth.\n\nI played around with this for a few hours before the website went down and had many failed or broken conversations. I suspect these may have been errors stemming from the few things layered on top of the AI for this website rather than from the AI itself, but I cannot be sure. Nonetheless, I did have several very interesting dialogues with \"teachers\" whom I thought it would be interesting to converse with.\n\nBelow are some screenshots from one of the dialogues that I had, this one with Socrates. The only writing that I did are the pieces written directly after \"Me:\". This does not include two pieces that came up after the text after \"Me:\" and before Socrates' response but which were not written by me. Those two pieces are the ones beginning with \"(This is a list of\" and \"You are aware of\". The last thing I should mention is that in the dozens of dialogues that I had on this website, none of the others had the pattern you will see where the responses from the teacher (in this case, Socrates) were supplemented by additional text in parentheses. With that introduction, you have about as much context as I do to understand what is going on with the dialogue below, so I will leave it up to you to interpret for yourself. All I will say is that it certainly seems interesting and it feels like a technology unlike anything I have ever experienced before."}]}

I eat meat primarily out at restaurants and not super regularly but definitely a good amount. Burgers, steaks, prosciutto sandwiches, charcuterie with red wine, pulled pork in a burrito, bacon with breakfast. Despite my enjoyment of these meats I do believe it is something I could fairly easily give up for a month, but at the very least a week, including chicken and turkey but excluding eggs and fish (allowed to eat both). I just looked this up and it would make me an ovo-pescatarian. I never heard of that but it sounds kind of cool. OVO for short. Maybe one day that will be associated more commonly with the diet than with the rapper Drake.\n\nThe reason I am writing about this subject today is because for the first time this morning I chose to eat a plant-based meat. It was Beyond Meat Beyond Sausage and I am happy to say beyond my expectations. I do not think I would have questioned whether it was real meat if someone gave it to me without telling me. This was a good place for me to start because sausage is near the bottom of the list of meats I most regularly eat or enjoy, making it the most optimal candidate for substitution. As a general believer in moderation over quitting cold turkey (with this second pun, I am realizing how heavily meats are integrated into language itself), I now think I will begin to consciously shift to eating less meat starting with the easiest opportunities and as it inevitably becomes easier to do when eating out. I say this without any desire to fully stop my meat consumption or even cut it in half at this point, but I would gladly have this sausage instead of real pork sausage at a standard breakfast spot where the sausage is just decent anyway, and I think I would enjoy it ground up in a lunch burrito if it was offered like that as well. I am not going to stop eating burgers or steaks or prosciutto sandwiches, but I can and will do better, even if it is just by 10-20%, and maybe just by doing that and writing about it and talking about it others will do a little bit better to, and the impact of small choices we know can be large.\n\nI thought about the primary reason I had not tried plant-based meat already. I had not tried it because any time it was offered I figured the real meat was already at the restaurant and if I didn’t eat it someone else would and if it was not served before it went bad it would be wasted so what the heck just give me what I’m used to eating, but that’s a poor logic to justify my human tendency to resist change. Individual by individual and instance by instance as people eat less meat, restaurants and stores will order less and suppliers will produce less and I therefore assume that in the end less animals would be treated poorly and killed. It is convenient that the best kinds of meat that people most enjoy are the high quality ones that often come from the free range, pasture raised, grass fed, no steroid, etc., more ethically treated animals. Because of that, if we can just cut our consumption of the lower quality stuff that we enjoy less anyway, we will be successful in opposition of the worst part of the problem first. Financial professionals are familiar with LIFO and FIFO methods of accounting. I will call this the WIFO method of meat replacement, the Worst Is First Out. Driven by increases in our awareness of the issues, the availability of better substitutions, and our societal desire to treat animals better, I believe there will be a significant shift in the relative near-term.\n\nLastly, I think a great idea to accelerate this transition would be to establish a “No Meat Week”. Like I said, I believe most people could fairly easily go OVO for a week. Imagine how powerful it would be if people’s small efforts to cut down on meat were concentrated within just one week, and coordinated to happen all at the same time. That would have a profound impact on restaurants and suppliers and provide a serious wake up call for the industry to shift business fast. I am sure celebrities, influencers, and relevant companies would be all over it once it got enough legs. I am not the person passionate enough about this issue to properly evangelize it, but I’ll do it myself and write about it here and tell a few people. Who knows what the butterfly effect could be. So, without any further ado...\n\nI hereby declare the first full week of March 2020 NO MEAT WEEK.\n\nIt is on my calendar with a location of anywhere and a description to “Go OVO”. Feel free to join me."}]}

That’s an ordinary way start to the day for most Americans. But it was an extraordinary way to start the day for me. You see, I hadn’t had a caffeinated cup of coffee in more than a year and a half. Last year, I wrote about why. Today, I am writing about why I broke that streak, and it starts with focusing on streaks themselves. \n\nStreaks are unique. They are useful because they make continuance the default whereas the opposite of whatever you are doing or not doing to continue the streak might have otherwise been the default. In this case, not drinking caffeinated coffee became my default whereas drinking caffeinated coffee might have otherwise been my default if I did not care about continuing the streak. Exercise is another good example. You might not ordinarily exercise on a day where you are extraordinarily busy, but if you have a 78-day streak going, you are probably going to find a way to make it happen that day, for the sake of the streak. \n\nStreaks are powerful because they add more relative value to the incremental continuance of the streak than that increment would have held in absolute value on its own were it not for its relevance to the streak. For example, if you miss just 1 day of exercise in a year versus missing 0 days, the difference in the percentage of days you exercised is only 0.27% (1-(364/365)), but if, let’s say, that day occurred halfway through the year, your longest streak of consecutive days exercised is cut by 50% (182/365). In that sense, the impact on the streak is ~200x as large as the impact on the percentage of days you exercised that year (50.00% vs. 0.27%), so if you’re focused on the streak as opposed to the overall hit rate, the impact of missing 1 day is 200x as important.\n\nThe psychological power of the streak is extremely useful for some people in certain situations. For example, people recovering from alcoholism or other addictions can benefit greatly from the zero tolerance policy that the outsized importance of extending a streak incentivizes. For those people in those situations, a single exception can be a slippery slope resulting in an extended relapse. It could be argued that that slope is made more slippery by the streak itself and the outsized weight that is placed on its breaking as a result of the outsized weight that is placed on its continuance, but I would give the benefit of the doubt to the idea that sobriety streaks are net positives for addicts overall.\n\nNow, coming back to why I decided to have a caffeinated coffee today, it was mostly for the purpose of breaking my streak which I felt was becoming more important than not drinking coffee actually meant to me. I still believe in everything I wrote about why I quit caffeine more than a year ago. I don’t expect my drinking coffee today to lead to a regular habit of drinking coffee in perpetuity. But basically I know now (and have known for a while) that I can quit coffee any time (the substitute habit of drinking decaf being the key to helping me do that sustainably where I had not as sustainably done it in the past). I don’t need to never have another coffee again. \n\nI believe in moderation and balance. While I still believe it is best for me personally to not be a daily or even weekly coffee drinker forever, I suspect that the occasional cup of coffee may be beneficial, even marginally, to my life as a whole. It is for similar reasons that I don’t expect to ever entirely give up alcohol even though I have generally trended towards drinking less of it over the last several years. Just like coffee, I don’t believe it is best for me personally be drinking alcohol daily (obviously) or even weekly forever, but I do believe the occasional scotch or tequila on the rocks can be beneficial to my life as a whole.\n\nIt’s funny. When I first quit coffee, I had the occasional cravings that one would expect. Even several months after, I would have an infrequent temptation – a Sunday morning on a rare vacation on a beautiful summer day with a fresh pot of coffee in the kitchen, made for the house. Most of those days I would quell the craving with a decaf. But today was not one of those days where I had a big craving or temptation. Part of the reason I felt good about breaking the streak was because I did not feel that craving or temptation. I wasn’t giving into anything. I wasn’t losing the streak. I was breaking it, intentionally, on my own terms, because it just wasn’t that big of a deal. I felt like the streak was starting to over-inflate the importance of a zero-tolerance policy towards coffee in my life. So I decided to break the streak. \n\nI enjoyed my first coffee in a long time. And I was pleased to confirm that both the taste and the ritual were indistinguishable from drinking a decaf. The difference is strictly confined to the feeling and the buzz of consuming caffeine itself. And I’m not going to lie, that made this blog post a little extra nice to write."}]}

I think it is because I was only first introduced to the non-on/off type of light switch relatively later on in my childhood. It must have been in a hotel or somewhere cool that led me to associate it this way, and we have a few in our family home which we moved to when I was in the 5th grade, so it must have been sometime before then that I first used one. Regardless, it seems preferable to me to have options between having the lights all the way on or all the way off, so I have always enjoyed that opportunity as it is afforded by the dimmer.\n\nIt seems intuitive to me that most people are like me in that they enjoy the opportunity to have options between two extremes. If you put 100 people in a room with an on/off light switch and asked them to vote their preference, you would force people to choose an extreme and end up with a majority voting to have the light either on or off, and the outcome would be based on majority rule. If those same 100 people in that same room, however, had a dimmer, they could vote in a variety of ways for a variety of options and the consensus outcome could be to have the lights at any level in between off and on. It seems likely that more people would be more pleased with the outcome that way.\n\nThe real world works more like the room with the dimmer. We have complex means by which outcomes are selected and people's preferences exist all over the spectrum. There are people at both extremes who believe we should have the lights all the way on or all the way off, but the vast majority of people see that the best solution lies somewhere in the middle. In an effective voting system, that is where the outcome would land. It would change gradually over time as the people would be conscious to move slowly enough not to trip any unforeseen adverse effects that may be experienced by moving too quickly along the path of attempted progress. Along the way, there would be regressions in the opposite direction too of course, likely in the form of reactions to those unforeseen adverse effects that despite general caution would inevitably be triggered.\n\nIn the real world, the tug of wars between extreme progress and the status quo, anchored by entrenched interests and pulled the other way by extreme regress, rage on for every issue across the board, and the ribbons on the ropes representing the current statuses of the issues lie somewhere in between extremes, with both sides tugging at the rope until they cross the threshold and win the war. The war is won when the middle has been pulled far enough to one side that the old extreme becomes the new norm, and a new war has formed. This does not happen overnight. It happens over the course of weeks, months, years, decades, and centuries, even millenia. The time it takes to resolve depends on the power and the reach of the impact of the issue. A battle over local library hours in a small township, for example, will not last nearly as long as the ongoing battle between science and religion.\n\nFor the sake of the comparison I am about to make, let us now disassociate the traditional positivity and newness associated with light and the corresponding negativity and oldness associated with dark. Let us instead assume that the light room represents the old world and the dark room represents the new world. By definition, if the dark room is the new world and the light room is the old world, we are as a matter of fact transitioning from the light room to the dark room. The only question is how we will get there, and at what speed. If we are in the room with the dimmer, the transition can happen at any rate over any period of time depending on how the people in the room see fit, but the room will eventually be dark, and they will have arrived in the new world that many had long envisioned. If, however, we are in the room with only an on/off switch, the lights must turn off at some individual instant. In that case, the people's eyes will not have the luxury of being able to adjust over time. They will at first be shocked and almost entirely unable to see, but just for a moment before their eyes will quickly adjust, as eyes always do, and as humans always do. The transition is more sudden and instantaneously scarier without the dimmer, but it is quicker with the on/off switch, and it forces us to adjust faster.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the world has figuratively turned off the lights. The people are in shock, but they are quickly adjusting. And the good news for those who don't is that we will soon return to some form of light. Many already realize that it is impractical to stay in the dark. We are not ready for it yet, and too many people will suffer. Most agreed that we needed to turn the lights out for a bit because it became predictable that too many people were going to die in the light. We turned the lights off to give ourselves some time to see how those predictions played out and to figure out a better way to operate with the lights on, and as we figure that out, or as the dark begins to threaten more livelihoods than the light does lives, we will use the dimmer to bring back some unknown level of light at some unpredictable speed.\n\nIt is important to recognize, however, that even if we could go back to the same level of light as before (i.e. if an extremely successful vaccine was discovered, produced and made available in limitless quantities starting tomorrow), even then, the room still will have changed.\n\nIt will have changed because the people in it will have now lived in the dark and many of them will have already adjusted to it. Everyday the lights stay off, more and more people are seeing the future in the dark. Many of them will not go back to many of the ways they used to live in the light. New world inevitabilities like decentralized systems of money, remote work, and online education have now been tested by necessity rather than curiosity and the transitions in their directions will be accelerated by this momentary turning off of the lights.\n\nThe winners in this new world will be determined as in most cases by a combination of preparedness and luck. They will be those who saw certain aspects of what the new world looked like and acted fast enough to position themselves properly before the lights went out. Those people must now feel like Muhammad Ali, not just because they are winners, but because they were \"in bed before the room was dark\".\n\nI have seen many people suggest that the way we are living now is the new normal. It is not. On the other side, I have seen many people suggest that the world will go back to the way it used to be. It will not. It never does."}]}

Thus far I have found no reason to argue with the validity of the company's slogan that it is \"the fastest email experience ever made\". I heard Superhuman CEO, Rahul Vohra, interviewed by Harry Stebbings on The Twenty Minute VC podcast and he seems to be taking an extraordinarily smart approach through the company's early days. The thing I remember most is how they are strategically ignoring feedback from customers who do not most love the product (by definition, most customers), despite the natural inclination that many founders have to try to please most of their customers.\n\nAs I have become accustomed to my new way of email, there are many benefits that stand out. In no particular order, I have enjoyed the read receipts (which are device-specific with time stamps), the many keyboard shortcuts (from \"mark done\" to \"remind me later\"), and the ability to flip through inboxes (email addresses) by simply pressing alt+1, alt+2, etc..\n\nThe ability to seamlessly move across inboxes has made me more inclined to create separate email addresses not only to represent separate entities, but also to serve separate functions. I already had separate entity emails for personal, blog, fireresumes.com, and real estate, but I recently created one more to be used as a read-only email address. As the name suggests, any email that comes to this email address is an email that is for reading only, and I never really need to \"get through\" that inbox. I have mentioned previously my critical views on the constant distractions of email, even to the point where I wrote about why I would not subscribe to my own blog. That has since changed. I now use my read-only email address to subscribe to any and every newsletter and blog that I like to read, without having to worry about them cluttering precious inbox real estate. I will not share the name of that email address because even if you were to email me there, I would not respond (you can always reach me on my blog email linked above and I will be sure to respond). In fact, I do not expect I will ever intentionally send a single email from this new email address. It is strictly for receiving and collecting my favorite newsletters and generally any of the things that I like to read or stay updated on that are made available to be served over email. These emails will never again be a distraction, but I will always know where they are waiting to be read at my leisure. That is the way that read-only emails should be."}]}

Since then, I have stuck to 3 miles every time that I have gone out for a jog, with so few exceptions in the last 4 months that I could count them on one hand. My 5-mile run this morning could be categorized as one of those exceptions, but I do not view it as such. I view it as Day 1 of a new normal. I am going to start running slower and further again. The cold weather makes me want to, and reading Christopher McDougall’s book Born to Run over the last week has added fuel to the fire.\n\nMy 5-mile loop is largely the same as my regular 3-mile loop, except with a 2-mile detour in the middle. Near the end of my run this morning, I approached the same final mile that I have run a hundred times before. There used to be an old bridge that I crossed near the beginning of that final mile. For the last few months, that bridge was under construction. There were bulldozers and cones, dumpsters and porta potties, large mounds of dirt and rocks... just about everything but progress from the look of it. For a while, there was a large crater of a hole in the ground, but nothing I couldn’t run around. Most recently, they filled the hole and built rock walls on both sides of where the old bridge was and the new bridge would be. That was the latest I had seen of it as of last Friday, so I was surprised today when I turned the corner to my final mile and the road looked all but done. Fresh asphalt was being rolled over to smooth any bumps in the road. The black track looked immaculate.\n\nI stuck to the sides as I ran by with less room now than I had with the hole. The ground on the side of the road was uneven and my sneakers sunk with every step as the leaves covered soft soil from Sunday’s rain. The man on the rolling machine signaled to me that I could run on the road if I wanted to, and I did. I dropped down off the side and stepped foot on the freshly paved road. It was a road no one had run before and a road I had run a hundred times, depending on how I looked at it. I could feel the slightest stick when I pulled each foot off the ground, enough to wonder if any asphalt would remain cemented to the bottom of my shoes, but not enough to worry. I could feel my feet smushing down ever so slightly when I pushed each foot down onto the ground, enough to wonder if my footprints might faintly remain on this road for as long as it lasted, not enough so that when I looked down over my shoulder I could see my steps behind me, but enough to hope. The next time I run on that road, you can bet I’ll be looking for footsteps. \n\nAs I took my last steps on the new road and passed the line where it met with the old, I processed the pleasure of running on fresh asphalt. The term “fresh asphalt” stuck out in my mind like certain words do all the time. I usually take a note to remind myself it is something I might want to write about. I started thinking of what I could write as I continued to run, step step, step step, step step. I started to look for meaning in the fresh asphalt now behind me. How could I use it as a metaphor? How did it represent a sign? I had some ideas but I didn’t obsess over it. In fact, I forgot about it by the end of my run. I walked laps of the driveway to cool down and finished the podcast I was listening to. I took down a few notes from that -- “podcasts are a dance”, “the key is listening and thinking and being genuinely curious, it’s gotta be real”, “when I’m at my best, I’m dancing”. Joe Rogan had taken a rare turn on the other side of the mic, appearing as a guest on Lex Fridman’s podcast, which was the perfect duration for my 5-mile run and cool down. Then, randomly, I remembered, “fresh asphalt”. I wrote it down in my notes. \n\nI went inside and showered and between getting out and getting dressed the lights in my room faded and the power was out. In the shower, I had thought of the title, Fresh Asphalt & Road Signs. I still didn’t know exactly what I was going to write about, but I recalled this quote of mine that I think of relatively often which involves signs and roads. A lot of people like to look for signs in life, and that’s fine. I am one of them to some degree. As I said, once I got passed the new road, I started thinking immediately about what it could mean or how I could use it. The quote I keep in mind about signs is to remind myself that not everything must have a meaning, and that not everything must be used as a means to an end. Some things just are what they are. They can be ends and just ends. The way my quote goes is this:\n\n“If you spend your whole life looking for signs, you’ll never get to enjoy the road.”\n\nMaybe the fresh asphalt today was a sign of a fresh start. Perhaps more than only the literal path has finally become clear again. It all could mean that I am starting down a new road, a clean one, a good one. Or maybe it just was what it was. Fresh asphalt. It was a pleasure to run on."}]}

I believe my perspective on Bitcoin is more reasonable than many of its strongest supporters and more knowledgeable than most all of its detractors.\n\nMy goal with The Fundamentals of Bitcoin is to give people a fundamental and practical introduction to what Bitcoin is and why they might care about it. For those who find this introduction compelling, I will conclude with actionable instructions for how one can quickly and easily invest in Bitcoin today. Inevitably, when I share with people the attractiveness of Bitcoin as an investment, they ask me how much I would recommend they invest. This is a question that everyone must answer for themselves and I will explain why. Still, I will share why I believe investing 1% of one’s money in Bitcoin may be a sensible place to start. I hope you enjoy this resource regarding what may well prove to be one of the most impactful technologies of our time.\n\nClick here for free access to The Fundamentals of Bitcoin."}]}

But I believe that when it comes to audio vs. video communication, more often than not, less is more.\n\nAudio-only is less distracting than video calls. You can focus on the speaker’s voice instead of their bad hair day or visual tic. You will not be distracted by the goings on of any of the other people on the call who aren’t speaking at all. If you are one of those non-speakers yourself, you can focus on actively listening instead of actively looking like you’re listening. Even if these things only occupy 10% of your conscious thought, that’s a lot of unnecessary distraction. Most people have a hard enough time focusing for long periods of time without this 10% handicap, and I think for many people it may be much greater than 10%. In summary, to use the somewhat over-used phrase, audio-only has less noise, more signal.\n\nIn my personal experience, for whatever combination of reasons, I find audio-only generally makes for realer conversations, which are better conversations. I find them more enjoyable. That’s why I prefer them.\n\nI am not just writing this. I live by it and encourage you to try it. I record all of my podcasts audio-only. I join Zooms audio-only and hide the window with everyone’s faces. I rarely FaceTime my family or friends — I just call them. Usually I’ll go for a walk while we talk, another thing you can’t so easily or acceptably do with video calls.\n\nMost people and businesses started using video calls in recent years due to the advent of apps like FaceTime and Zoom, respectively. Since COVID, video calls have become the default. I believe this is wrong. Try some more audio-only communications if you can. See if it feels more right."}]}

Be Unique. Play All Day.\n\nI have been doing a lot of thinking lately. I do not have a full-time job, nor any real urgency to get one. So, I find myself in a fortunate position where I have sole control over how I spend most of my time.\n\nThe questions that I'm thinking about lately revolve around how I want to spend my days and what I want to do with my life. I think these questions are worth thinking a lot about. After all, time is the scarcest resource we all have. So what will I do with mine? What will I do with my days, weeks, months, years, and life? Those are the questions that I like to think about.\n\nFundamentally, I want to live a life well-lived. If I could have a moment to look back just before I die, I'd like to think that I really lived -- that I did life right, not according to anyone else's definition, but according to my own. I'd like to have done some things that felt good and meaningful, and to have enjoyed the ride. That is why I try to do both the things that I want to do and the things I'll be glad I did.\n\nI want to be happy, sure, but more than that, I want to be great. I want to inch closer and closer to my potential. There's an unattributed quote that says something like, \"the definition of hell is, on your last day on earth, you meet the person you could have been.\" I'd like to meet that person and be uncertain as to whether they lived their life any better than I did at all. Maybe that's heaven.\n\nRecently, a few concepts have been re-occurring in my head fairly relentlessly. I am thinking that is probably because they are really important. The super summarized takeaways from each are as follows:\n\n  1. Think Big\n\n  2. Be Unique\n\n  3. Play All Day\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a bit more detail on each including quotes from others and summaries of my interpretations.\n\n### Think Big.\n\n> One thing about business that people don’t realize: it takes just as much effort to create a small business as it does to create a large one.\n> \n> Whether you’re Elon Musk or the guy running three Italian restaurants in town, you’re working 80 hours a week; you’re sweating bullets; you’re hiring and firing people; you’re trying to balance the books; it’s highly stressful; and it takes years and years of your life.\n> \n> In one case, you get companies worth $50-$100 billion and everyone’s adulation. In the other, you might make a little bit of money and you’ve got some nice restaurants. So think big.\n> \n> Naval Ravikant (Source)\n\n> I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.\n> \n> If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.\n> \n> If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it.\n> \n> Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.\n> \n> Sam Altman (Source)\n\n> It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you\n> \n> It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason\n> \n> Nat Friedman (Source)\n\nBig businesses are not that much harder than small businesses. Big projects tend to be more exciting to work on, which makes them easier for you to work on, and more attractive to others who may be able to help. Considered together, big things may not be harder than small things at all, and the payoff is much greater. So, you might as well think big.\n\n### Be Unique.\n\n> The key thing to develop over time is, what are you going to be incredibly awesome at? There’s a great quote I discovered reading a Pat Riley book 20 years ago where he’s quoting Jerry Garcia from The Grateful Dead. He says \"you don’t want to be the best at what you do, you want to be the only one who does what you do.\" You want to develop strengths that are unique or world-class over time that become your competitive advantage and you want double down on those as much as possible and find companies and roles that leverage them to your maximum potential.\n> \n> Keith Rabois (Source)\n\n> Don't aim to be the best. Be the only. That's a very high bar because it requires a tremendous amount of self-knowledge and awareness to get to that point to really understand what it is that you do better than anyone else in the world. And for most of us, it takes all of our lives to figure that out. And we also by the way need family, friends, colleagues, customers, clients, everyone around us to help us understand what it is that we do better than anyone else, because you can't really get there by yourself. You can't do \"thinkism\". You can't think your way there. You have to try to live it out and that's why most people's remarkable lives are full of detours and dead ends and right turns, because it's a very high bar, but if you can get there, you don't need a resume, there's no competition, and it's easy for you because you're doing it. You're not looking over your shoulder. You're just right there. So, don't aim to be the best. Be the only.\n> \n> Kevin Kelly (Source)\n\n> If you want an average successful life, it doesn’t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:\n> \n> 1\\. Become the best at one specific thing.  \n>  2\\. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.\n> \n> The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don’t recommend anyone even try.\n> \n> The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.\n> \n> Scott Adams (Source)\n\nYou don't just want to be the best at what you do. You want to be the only one who does what you do. Then you have no competition. You are the best by default. Find and combine your strengths and apply them together in a way that is completely unique. Then go all in on whatever that is. That will be your personal monopoly. Incorporating the previous point, try to make it a big monopoly, but make sure it's still a monopoly.\n\n### Play All Day.\n\n> To this day, I don't enjoy working. I enjoy playing, and figuring out how to connect playing with business. To me, that's my niche. People talk about my work ethic as a player, but they don't understand. What appeared to be hard work to others was simply playing for me.\"\n> \n> Michael Jordan (Source)\n\n> What feels like play to you, but looks like work to others?\n> \n> Naval Ravikant (Source)\n\n> The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.\n> \n> Steve Jobs (Source)\n\nLastly, just play. Find something you love to do and just play all day. Play in a way that looks like work to others. You cannot work hard enough to beat the person who is playing because they can play longer than you can work. They can play all day every day. So you have to play. You have to love what you do. Loving what you do is a great end goal in and of itself, but it is also a means, the only means to doing great work. Relating the previous points, any area in which you play may be an area where you can be great. Combine a few of these areas to find something only you can do, to find your personal monopoly, then make it big.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn closing, let's consider these three principles in reverse order.\n\nFind what you love to do, what feels like play to you but looks like work to others. Consider which of those things you are strongest at and most likely will be able to develop further. These should be things that you love to do -- things that feel like play. If they were not, you would probably not be that strong at them. Once you have a list of those things, consider how you can combine two or a few of them in a way that seems like it could be big, while remaining unique.\n\nAsk yourself, how can you play your way to a massive personal monopoly? How can you become the only one who does what you do? These questions and quotes may help, but the answer is unlikely to be so formulaically findable. Like Kevin Kelly said, it may be the case that, \"You can't think your way there. You have to try to live it out.\" Personally, I don't think I've found my thing. In fact, I'm pretty darn sure I haven't.\n\nI didn't write this in hopes of doing so, but I do believe that with all this in mind, just for having written it, I will be better prepared to recognize once I've found it. Hopefully, that will allow me to go all in on the right thing once it appears. As a bonus, maybe this will help you too.\n\nThink big. Be unique. Play all day.\n\nThink big. Be unique. Play all day.\n\nThink big. Be unique. Play all day."}]}

Those days are started late and ended early, respectively. Every other day is the same, 24 hours.\n\nMost of what happens within our days are the results of choices, concious or otherwise. I may choose to sleep 8 hours while someone else chooses only to sleep 5. I am sure you have often heard people respond to something that they say they want to do with “I don’t have time”. \"I know I should work out but I don’t have time ... I wish I spent more time with my kids but I don’t have time ... I love to read but I just don’t have time anymore.\" These people are either lying to you, or more likely, they are lying to themselves.\n\nMost of us feel we do not have time for things but in reality we do not have the relative desire for them. We may want them, but we do not want them as much as the other things we are doing with our time. If we did, we would do them instead. Importantly, I am not referring to a spoken want but an actual one. I can say I want six pack abs but if I am not willing to put in the physical work to get there I don’t really want that more than the other things I spend my time doing during my days.\n\nMost of the time, most people don’t truly want hardly anything as much as they want to check Instagram or Twitter or email. Of course, these are not the things they want directly but a means towards getting them. A dopamine hit from an Instagram like, a bite size piece of information or entertainment from a Tweet, or a sense of purpose through a feeling that one is needed, good at their job, and therefore good at something because they are known to respond to their emails in less than 10 minutes no matter the hour or the day. I know these things from experience.\n\nThe fact is that when one truly wants something and wants it more than everything else competing for the time in their day, one will absolutely make the time for that thing. Time does not come out of thin air. It comes from the other things we occupy ourselves doing. Everything is a trade-off. We operate based on a descending list of the things we care about whether we know them are not.\n\nTo understand what a real want feels like, it is helpful to think about and experience the fundamentals. Years ago, I watched an awesome motivational speech by a guy named Eric Thomas where he tells his students they will be successful when they want it as badly as a person who is drowning wants to breathe (if you want to watch the first 3 minutes you will get the gist). Occasionally, I run several miles without a water bottle and I am reminded in the last couple of miles what it feels like to be truly thirsty, to want nothing but water. When you are sick, you usually want nothing but to feel better. When you are starving, all you want to do is eat. You will make time for what you want most. We can only do so much at a time and more distractions than ever are competing for our attention. This is why so many people feel there is not enough time in the day.\n\nNext time you think about something you want to do or know you should do but “don’t have time” for, think again. You have the time, you just don’t care enough. In many cases, you will be content with that realization. In others, you will want to change it. Fortunately, you can. It is not about time. It is about you."}]}

One good demonstration of this cause and effect considers the use of two subtly different contractions with important implications, don't and can't.\n\nAs the title of this post suggests, I find that in most cases the former is greater than the latter, as in better and more useful. Don't often implies a choice (\"I don't smoke\") or an order (\"Don't touch the stove\"). Can't , on the other hand, often implies a restriction, whether it be self-imposed (\"I can't smoke\") or a rule (\"You can't touch the stove\").\n\nI like choices. I know a lot of people who like choices. I do not like rules. I do not know a lot of people who like rules. My intuition tells me people are more likely to rebel against things that they do not like than things that they do like. Thus, they are more likely to go against rules than choices.\n\nI will acknowledge that it is easier said than done, but if you want to stop a bad habit for instance, try thinking and talking about it in terms of don't rather than can't. You may find it to be more effective."}]}

It will make some people sad. It will make some people happy. For me it is the latter.\n\nHis previous album, Swimming , was a long departure from \"Easy Mac with the cheesy raps\", the high school kid whose 2010 song, Nikes on My Feet , would have me listening to his music for the next decade. Swimming may have hardly been a rap album, but it was easily my favorite Mac album.\n\nNow, Circles closes the loop. It ventures even further away from a traditional rap album, but I have always enjoyed all of Mac's music, even that of his jazzy alter ego, Larry Lovestein. I have listened to Circles only once through this morning, but I like it. I appreciate its existence, even after his. My favorite songs on my first listen were Everybody , That's On Me , and Surf , in the order that they appear. Still, I will likely listen to Circles mostly in its entirety as an album, just like I did with Swimming.\n\nI hope you will give it a listen.\n\nFor those who do not know, Mac died at 26 from an accidental drug overdose, a combination of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol. It is a story that is far too common these days. Rest in Peace, Mac.\n\n[URL]"}]}

Disclaimer given, I am going to use it as follows.\n\nThere are two kinds of people. Those who say “we should” and those who say “I will”. \n\nI learned this from my experience pledging back in college. There are a lot of problems that arise during pledging and a lot of things that need to be figured out and taken care of as a group. In such an environment, one comes to appreciate the people who say “I will” much more than the people who say “we should”. \n\nEveryone has ideas. It is easy, immediate, and mostly inconsequential to offer them. A lot of times this person even gets some credit for contributing, in their own mind if not in everyone else’s. Anyone can suggest things “we should” do. They can do it all day without lifting a finger.\n\nIt is harder to say “I will”. In saying “I will”, one is committing to doing something. The onus is on them. They have given themselves the responsibility to take care of something and they have stated its upcoming completion as a fact. Less people are willing to do this. It requires the time and effort to do the work. It exposes one to become at fault if the thing does not get done. It does not do anything in particular for the person, but it does do something for the group. This is a real contribution.\n\nNot everyone is a “get s* done” kind of guy or girl. For those who are, getting things done is just what they do. On the flip side, getting a “we should” kind of person to get a thing done can sometimes seem like an impossible task, almost certainly harder than the one at hand. While I learned this during pledging, it applies just as aptly in business, sports, or any other group setting. \n\nAs I noted in the beginning, things are always more complicated than the phrase, “there are two kinds of people.” Chances are, you have probably said both “we should” and “I will” many times in your life, if not in the last week. Regardless of where one stands on the spectrum, I have reminded myself and would encourage others to be more conscious about their usage of these two phrases.\n\nInstead of saying “we should”, say “I will”. Then do what you say you will do. When it is not something that impacts a group, replace “I should” with “I will”. In this case, you will not be helping any group but you will find that you are helping yourself.\n\nThe next step after turning oneself into the kind of person who says “I will” is to evolve into the kind of person who says “I did”. At that point, you are taking care of things proactively before they are even being discussed. This requires thinking ahead, figuring things out, and getting them done. These kinds of people don’t care about a consensus for how everyone thinks something should be done. They just know what needs to be done and get it done however they can and see fit. \n\nThe final step does not require saying anything at all. Actions speak louder than words. The best kind of person to have in any group is the one who gets things done without telling anyone either that they are going to do it or that they did. It’s just done. Everyone knows a person who gets things done. Let that person be you.\n\nStart now. Instead of saying that you should become this kind of person, say that you will."}]}
